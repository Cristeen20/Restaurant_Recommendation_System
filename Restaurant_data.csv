Checked this place out on a recommendation and wasn�t disappointed.', 'Top notch tacos filled with fresh , quality ingredients . Also large selection of self serve sauces to spice up the tacos.. The manager was extremely helpful and friendly. Nice outdoor seating area.', 'The food was delicious and quick to receive! Fair prices and the staff were super nice and helpful! I had the  chicken tacos and the sauce on the chicken really stood out to me- it was delicious! Would be down to go back!', 'Food is great as usual and very consistent, staff are amazing and I really appreciate how they treat their customer.\nThey are taking health and safety seriously', 'We had taken takeouts from this place few times We had some chips and salsa to start. We tried a few different tacos and fajitas and some good beer to wash it down. Overall lovely experience', 'I have eaten burritos in different countries and this is by far the greatest burrito I have ever had. The quality, taste and attention to detail. Amazing value as well for what you get. The quesadillas are also great. I can�t imagine any other burrito...place being better than here. Whenever I go here there is a large queue, I can see why.More', 'We live in the area and eat here at least once a month - sometimes more. The Cali-burrito is hands down the best. Highly recommended. Fast. Easy. Delicious.', ""I visited this place on a weekday evening. They don�t have any table reservations and it's the first come basis. You place your order on the counter and then go and find yourself a table. The food is delivered at the table. There is a...common area where water & cutlery is available for self service.\n\nThe place stands out from the other Mexican places because of their Salsa counter. They have 7 different kinds of Salsas which are free with your meal. Try some of the spicy salsas at your own risk. Their Ghost Salsa is extremely spicy. Now, let�s talk about food. I tried their Veggie Burrito, Mushroom Tacos & Grilled Avocado Taco. The portion sizes were good and value for money. They serve complimentary tortilla chips with every entree. Burritos had a quinoa filling but you can upgrade to rice for 1 dollar. Tacos were really good with a nice blend of sauces. For my taste buds, burrito felt a little dry though. Overall, a nice place to try some Mexican options.More"", 'Very quick and excellent customer service. Food was delicious and portion size was good. \nSalsa sauce is very fresh and good.', 'The service is quick, even though the place is busy at dinnertime. The tacos are delicious, the portions are good', 'Love love love their fajitas. ( tip :you can order half and half ) steak , shrimp or chicken \n\nTheir tacos are excellent too. \nThey have a great salsa bar ( help yourself ) and hot sauces galore. \n\nQuesadilla was ok. Haven�t tried the burritos...or the bowls yet as always order the fajitas. \n\nService is excellent. Food arrives quickly but fresh. \nLineups sometimes move slow as only one cashier but once you order food arrives quickly.More', 'Perfect place for some quick Mexican food. Well quick... portions are big so it might take some time! Prices are friendly and they have a salsa bar with mild and hot salsas for your tacos or burritos.', ""Love this place.  Went back twice in one week - both lunchtimes.  Only had tacos each time, they are small but reasonably priced and absolutely delicious.  Sweetcorn also great. Wish I had room to try other things like burritos, enchilladas etc.  Watermelon juice is outstanding...and cheap. If I lived nearby, they'd make a mint out of me - I'd be here every lunchtime.  Sauces are great - particularly the green one with coriander (cilantro).  Love the line-up of chilli sauces too.  Mmmm, making me salivate just thinking about it all.  Great service too.More"", 'This is one of the best taco joints in Toronto. The food is made with fresh quality ingredients and well seasoned. They have a wide selection of hot sauces, including house-made which adds great flavour and spice to any meal. The atmosphere is casual and...comparable to fast food. Despite how yummy the tacos were, the value is slightly higher than necessary for the experience.More', ""Enjoy the taco's that were relatively well prepared and tasty.  Quick in and out with a great buzz, limited options so easy to maneuver through the menu.  Will have to try the corn next time.  Thoroughly enjoyed the selection of sauces from mild to very...hot.More""]"
Adega,4.5 of 5 bubbles,"33 Elm St, Toronto, Ontario M5G 1H1 Canada","['Seafood', 'Mediterranean', 'European']",560 reviews,"[""Without Ryan the place has no charm. Wait staff are clueless,food has gone downhill,I think they have a new chef. Perhaps the seafood is no longer from Europe everyone got sick. The manager didn't do a thing about it. I won't ever step near one...of these locations.More"", ""I came here a year ago to celebrate my 40th birthday with my parents. It was a spectacular evening with perfect food and excellent service - Ryan was our waiter and he was attentive, charming, detail-oriented, and incredibly professional. It was an amazing evening -...total perfection.\n\nFast forward to a year later where, last night, I reserved at Adega for my boyfriend's 50th birthday. Service was below average for a restaurant of this calibre, it was actually a bit shocking to be honest with you and the food was not nearly as good. My steak and frites was mediocre at best and my boyfriend was not very impressed by the seafood risotto he ordered. We also ate the grilled squid and octopus with pork belly. \nIt became clear that quality on all levels had quickly deteriorated. We were disappointed but when we both got sick from the seafood overnight and the next day, I knew that it was truly the end of this restaurant for us, especially after I called the general manager and told him what had happened. He didn't take responsibility and still expected us to return. I like to give businesses an opportunity to make amends when things go wrong. The restaurant business is a tough business, especially now, and mistakes can happen, but I got the distinct sense that corners are being cut to safe costs and that's a very dangerous thing to be doing with seafood. I no longer trust the seafood at this restaurant and I am very particular about where I consume seafood. Where restaurants source their seafood is also very important to me. My recommendation - go to Terroni's - I have been eating seafood from them for years, they have excellent, consistent service and I have never gotten sick from their food.More"", 'We ate here during a recent trip to Toronto. We have visited Portugal a couple times and were looking forward to some portugese cuisine. My husband had the shrimp bisque to start and said it was very good. We had wines from the Alentjo region...by the glass and they paired well with our entrees.  For an entree my husband had the Cataplana, fresh fish stew, which he said was amazing, I had the monkfish dinner which hit the spot with me. For dessert we had the chocolate cake and the creme carmel which were very good. My husband had a double espresso to end the meal.  The prices were a bit more expensive than we expected, but the taste was authentic and delicious.More', 'Thumbs up for the grilled sea bass and the leek and potato soup.  Great service! Wonderful chocolate mousse dessert.', ""My Partner gave me a Thumbs Down on This selection - after a run of 5-6 Thumps-Up Picks on restaurant choices.\nThe place is very nice (albeit more A/C is needed) and the Service was very good - although a few workers looked almost suicidal....Now - the not so good stuff.\nThere is ZERO mention on their website that they do NOT serve their regular Menu - only Summerlicious items - this is NOT acceptable - MENTION this on your site - it takes 1 MINUTE to do.\nAnd then the Food  -  Tiny portions with Blandness as the Main Flavor.\nApps - I had the Caldo Verde Soup  - little kale, very very little meat, no salt, no flavor - yet somehow this was a Pass - Barely.\nMy partner had the Portuguese cheese  - his remark was is Portuguese cheese supposed to have the texture of Tofu? - Fail.\nNext the mains  - I had the Piri Chicken breast - Overdone with mediocre sauce - but again a Pass - Barely.  My partner's Mushroom Risotto left No response but he ate most of it - I don't think he liked it a lot.\nAnd then desserts - my Chocolate whatever was teeny tiny and flavorless - how do you make Chocolate flavorless? - and my partner had a Fruit Sorbet and finally declared - wow - some flavor at last !!!!!\nFor $65 pp - this is NOT a Good Food Menu.\nThe wine was overpriced But Every decent Restaurant does this.\nSo - despite the very lazy flavorless food and the high prices - I give this Restaurant a Pass - again Barely.\nExpected So Much More - Mentioning that this was my B-day at the Reservation point meant NOTHING.\nWish them the best  -  nice place and looks like they Try - but I doubt we will come back.More"", 'Booked a table on the basis of the very varied and reasonably priced menu on the website, but when we were seated were told they were only serving a $65 (plus taxes etc) fixed price three course menu, with only five choices for each for...the first two courses and three for the third. The food was very good, and the service attentive, but it was just not the meal we were intending  (and left a hefty dent in the wallet). Honestly, how hard is it to update the website?!More', 'When my son, Paul, asked me for a late lunch, a nearby Freshii  joint looked a probable choice, as we were hungry and had made no reservation. As we walked down the streets and landed at 33 Elm Street in front of  Adega, one of...seafood and Portuguese restaurants in Toronto,  warm reception by staff in otherwise nearly empty dining hall was welcome.  What I loved most about this restaurant was that the staff members  were  warm, exceptional and accommodating. And to cap it,  the food was delicious, making our first experience memorable. While I had Portuguese Beer, my son looked happy  Douro Red wine.  Starting with Octopus Pork Belly, we had  Cod  and Beef Tender loin with a chocolate cake as dessert at the end. It was all so delicious.Everyone from the host to  our waiter tonight were so knowledgeable, hospitable and accommodating. It was so pleasant to find this place  that has a patio and is still  a favourite choice for those who value Portuguese and seafood. The visit was like  finding a hidden gem as we both have been checking out various restaurants - Indian, Japanese, French Bistros, Thai and others  Adega deserves. a visit as it offers  some of the most authentic and exceptional Portuguese  dishes besides Beer.  We enjoyed the  evening. The settings are simple and  seating comfortable. The cocktail menu and wine menu are  reflective of old school European bistros with many great wines to select from. Thank you Adega, we will definitely  come back again soon!More', 'I wanted to rate this ""I wish it was better"".  We love this little historic strip in Toronto. We love that the little independent place is still in business. We love that they try to offer a variety of tasty Portuguese foods . But it...was pretty bad. \nWe ordered bread (at a charge) it came late. \nWe ordered wine - it came late. \nWe ordered dessert - it came late. \nWe asked for cutlery - it didn\'t come\nThe restaurant closed at 8:30 - we didn\'t know that.  And it\'s a Friday. They weren\'t closed for a private party - they just close at 8:30.  Had we been notified we would have booked elsewhere.  It was awkward - one of our party got locked outside while he went for a smoke.  It wasn\'t that it was busy and didn\'t notice - there was no-one else there.  I wish them luck. The food is good. The service is friendly. You can tell that they are trying. We want them to do well -  but I\'m not going back.  And if you decide to go - make sure you ask them what time they close.More', 'The atmosphere of Adega is great. Upscale, but not pretentious. The service is impeccable. Order the seafood, as it�s what they do best. The cod special was perfectly seasoned, and the seafood risotto was FILLED with lots of fish and shrimp. We also had soup...and dessert. We enjoyed every bite.More', 'Visited the restaurant with an early booking of 18:30 this was fairly quiet time which unfortunately led to a very quick service although the food was excellent I would have liked a bit more time to enjoy it. Our starters of sardines arrived which were...delicious but literally as we had our last mouthful the plates were swept away and our mains put down. As soon as it looked we completed our main the dessert menu was slapped down in front of us! When we declined due to insufficient timing we were then asked if we wanted the bill. We left the restaurant with our experience lasting just an hour with only 1 beer and sparking water purchased and a bill over just over 300 dollars. Shame as the venue and food deserved more time .More', 'Reserved a table for 2 and received confirmation from restaurant.\n2 hours before scheduled and approved reservation received a call from Marco that restaurant can�t accommodate us and reservation is canceled.', 'Last evening was our first vsit to Adega since COVID.  What a fabulous evening.  The food was even tastier than I remembered.  My fish melted in my mouth. Servings were generous. Service was  very profesional.  Our server  Ryan did not miss a beat. Drinks were...delivered as specified. I highly recommend this establishment.More', 'I haven�t been to Adega in years but it is definitely one of my favourite seafood and Portuguese restaurants in Toronto! What I love most about this restaurant is that the staff are absolutely exceptional not to mention that the food is delicious. Everyone from...the host to our wait stuff and especially Ryan our waiter tonight were so knowledgeable, hospitable and accommodating. I�m so thrilled that this place is thriving even after the last few years that restaurants have been struggling. If you haven�t been here it is definitely a hidden gem but also a long-standing institution in Toronto with some of the most authentic and exceptional Portugese food. We enjoyed the delicious and plentiful platter and tonight�s special app the avocado and tomato salad which were so robust with flavour! I myself have been looking forward to enjoying this cataplan fish stew as I have fond memories of coming here often and enjoying it especially on a cold rainy day like today. The seafood risotto looked beautiful as well! The cocktail menu and wine menu is reflective of old school European bistros with many great wines to select from. Lastly, check out this beautiful cloud of meringue enrobed in caramel! So heavenly! I will definitely have to come back again soon! Thank you again to the staff for this incredible experience!More', 'The Perfect Meal. My wife and I have had some great meals since things opened back up again but none that compared to this one. It is rare that exceptional service and attention to detail to the quality of absolutely everything served come together in...such a way. Every single thing (olives, bread, fresh fish, vegetables, dessert) was perfect. An unforgettable dining experience that contributed to a very special evening.More', 'This was our first exposure to Portuguese cuisine in the city and we were so impressed. Our servers Ryan and Ricardo were flawless in their understanding of the menu options, wines and our preferences.  They managed our table service very efficiently and helped us make...excellent culinary choices.\n\nThe Octopus and the fish soup were so fresh and tasty that we were talking about them for several days after the meal.  This is one restaurant that will be seeing more of us whenever we are in the city.\n\nMarco, the manager, runs a flawless operation here - perfect service and exquisite food.More']"
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,4.5 of 5 bubbles,"18 Duncan St, Toronto, Ontario M5H 3G8 Canada","['Asian', 'Thai', 'Vegetarian Friendly']","1,696 reviews","['Superb place with a great atmosphere. Food is excellent and great value. Loved it. When i go back to Toronto i will make a point to stop here again.', 'Imo it was all good. Food and service. The atmosphere was lively. Busy and popular. \nQuality of food was good. \n\nEating here with a group 4adults +4teens was planned so that we could order a decent variety of starters and mains and dessert to try...and then review.   We had plans after lunch which time-wise meant after the mango sticky rices (we shared 4 orders between 8 of us), we had to square up the bill.\n\n(-1*) The MSR were $12.50 each?!?  That�s the most expensive MSR I�ve eaten EVER (in any country!) for similar portion. \n\nGood place in the City to come to if you really crave to eat Thai street food.More', 'Came here recently as I recalled a good experience some years ago.  Had to wait for a table, despite obvious vacancies in the newer part.   Starters were fried in really heavy batter, certainly not the Thai batter I have had in many other places.  We...had the pad Thai and green curry as mains.  Both ok but nothing to write home about.  Not the cheapest meal, in fact mediocre value at best.   Won�t returnMore', 'It was. absolutely delicious. We went for lunch as a friends/business meeting and everyone loved it. We tried to make a reservation but couldn�t and it was very busy and a bit of a wait. Try to make a reservation if you can', ""This is excellent northern Thai cuisine! They serve khao soy which I have only ever had in Northern Thailand. It was relatively authentic and definitely delicious. We went mid-afternoon and it wasn't too busy and we were able to be seated right away. It is...often busy during normal meal times, however, and you can expect a wait.More"", ""The food here is amazing! Our group of 7 ordered papaya salad, laab salad, grabong (fried squash fritters), khao soi (curry), pad thai, pad gra prow, and khao pan baan nok (fried rice) and polished off almost everything. The flavors of all the dishes were...unique and complex while still very tasty. If we had to choose, our favorites would be the fried rice, pad thai, and grabong. \n\nAnother great thing is that the restaurant has many gluten free options to choose from along with options to request for certain dishes to be gluten free if they are not originally so. \n\nIf you're looking to come here, make sure to come early as the wait is long. We arrived at around 5 in the afternoon and had to wait around 50 minutes to get in while those who arrived after us had an even longer wait. However, the food was well worth the wait. During the rush hour, once you are seated you have 90 minutes until you must leave (but the people there were not super strict about the time limit).More"", 'I love Thai food and always up for checking out new places during my travels. This restaurant was not only close to the hotel but also highly reviewed. When I walked over to the restaurant for dinner and saw the wait of people outside I...knew it was good. Fortunately, they have some unique spaces for people to sit side by side and a few for single diners so I didnt have to wait. Very unique menu of traditional and more creative/innovative Thai dishes. I went more traditional with the chicken satay and the green curry. Note that the swerver said the hear level on the curry was fairly mild but it was quite spicy. The restaurant was packed and seems to be a popular destination. Not surprised since the servers were very friendly and the food was delicious.More', 'Absolutely delicious authentic thai food! I will return every time I am in Toronto for sure. The pad thai and pad see ew were some of the best I ever had', 'I�ve had Pai bookmarked in the event I visit Toronto and this time, I finally got to try it. I was excited because I love Thai food, and it seemed authentic but unfortunately, it fell short. I�ve read there�s always a wait and they don�t...accept reservations so we decided to go at around 1 PM on a rainy Sunday. We were quoted 45 min wait but only ended up waiting about 25. We ordered a drink at the bar while we waited. I had the Thai mojito and hubby had the Lowry. Both tasted pretty similar even though one was rum and one was gin. It�s probably because it was sickeningly sweet, so the sugar was all we tasted. \n\nFor food, a lot of items weren�t available until dinner time, so if there�s something specific you want to try, keep that in mind. We started with fried garlic shrimp, which was probably the only thing we liked. It was perfectly fried/crispy, and the tamarind dipping sauce it came with was nice. For drinks, hubby got a Thai iced tea which also way too sweet. For my main, I went with the Khao Soi with beef. The beef was flavorless - I had to dunk it in the chili oil it was served with. The broth was too salty. I don�t think I was even able to eat half the bowl. I wish it came with more pickled mustard greens. Hubby had the Gaeng Hunglay (sweet and sour garlic-ginger curry with braised oxtail). The flavor wasn�t bad but overall still a bit too salty. It could have used way more rice.\n\nMaybe the dinner experience is different/better? But it�s not worth the wait/trek/money for a lunch.More', 'Very busy but buzzy restaurant with excellent food and a great reggae soundtrack on the evening that we went. Very enjoyable.', 'Poor service with a very long waiting time, overpriced for average food and uncomfortable setting. . very disappointed!!\nThey even told us that we have 90 min to order, eat, pay and go. What a terrible way to treat guests!\nWIll not come back to...this restaurant..More', 'Extraordinary! Delicious and beautifully presented Thai food in the heart of Toronto. Definitely this is Toronto�s Tastiest Food�!!!! with the warmest hospitality! I can�t wait to visit again! Soooo good!!!!', 'Gotta try it! We went a few years ago and forgot where it was, have been hunting for it ever since, so happy when we found it again! Our favourite place to go when in the area!', 'What an amazing gem of a restaurant. Paolo S was our professional perfect server. Food is unbelievable good and priced perfect. Atmosphere was out of this world. Many thanks for a wonderful dinning experience!', 'Thai was solid but not exceptional. Service friendly but maybe understaffed. \nDecor simple. \nOverpriced and overrated.']"
The Keg Steakhouse + Bar - Esplanade,4.5 of 5 bubbles,"26 The Esplanade Esplanade, Toronto, Ontario M5E 1A7 Canada","['American', 'Steakhouse', 'Canadian']",899 reviews,"[""This restaurant was recommended by a friend who had recently visited Toronto. We're from Chicago and have many fine steakhouses and I would put The Keg near the top of the list! My husband began with an order of the calamari, which he had no...trouble finishing. He had a maitai to start and I had a glass of sauvignon blanc. For my entree I had the petit (7oz) filet mignon with garlic mash potatoes and vegetables. It was absolutely delicious! My husband had the 14 oz prime rib with garlic mash potatoes and vegetables and he virtually inhaled it! We received a complimentary slice of Billy Miner chocolate pie, which we probably could have done without, but had to taste it! Sam, our server, was wonderful. Halfway through our meal a family group of 6 adults and a small child (6 months old?) came in and were seated nearby. The adults were obnoxious in their attempts to keep the child amused and while we didn't rush through the rest of our meal, we were glad to get away from them because they ruined the mood of relaxation and enjoyment for everyone in our section. Prices were reasonable for the quality of the food and service.More"", 'Perfectly cooked fillet�.melted in the mouth.\nAlways enjoy our visits�.thanks for another lovely meal.', 'The KEG steakhouse at the Esplanande is a must for us, when visiting Toronto. Constantly good steaks at high level and very nice service.', 'Service was great and attentive.  They offered Specials that were all lobster based, and allowed to substitute a ribeye instead of a top sirloin for one of the specials.  Chicago style �char� was perfectly prepared.', 'We went to the Keg before and loved it but didn�t have a great experience this time� \n\nMy friends order The ribs and they were fine and the ribeye steak was ok. However, I ordered a steak medium rare and it came out blue and...mushy. Would recommend to ensure the servers hear what you or saying or you could be handed anything. \n\nThe cake was amazing, defo recommend. Wine was 10 out of 10.More', 'We enjoyed delicious prime rib and a nice base ball steak. Service is very friendly and swift. The atmosphere in the restaurant is nice and intimate. \n\nWe enjoyed!', 'Had a fantastic family dinner here tonight, three generations all had a brilliant meal which is hard to normally do but The Keg succeeded.\nAndy was our server and he was knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. \nA variety of dishes my mother in law and sister...in law both tried two different Vegan/vegetarian dishes (neither are vegan/vegetarian ) and said it was really tasty, that was the vegan shepherds pie and the vegetarian meatloaf. \nThe steaks were cooked to perfection absolutely delicious, my daughter who I gave her bits of my steak as she had the kids keg burger loved it and she is a really really picky eater. \nI would come back here again really tasty, great food.More', 'We were walk-ins, but made to feel really welcome.

They are the best for many years.', ""Hi again,\n\nWe're doing a lot of restaurant dining lately! I could get used to this!\n\nLast night we chose to dine at the Keg Steakhouse and Bar on the Esplanade in downtown Toronto. \n\nFor all my Canadian friends reading this, we all know that...there are Kegs everywhere! For my American friends reading this, if you come to Canada for a visit,  please don't leave without trying this lovely chain restaurant. If you're a steak fan, this is the place for you. \n\nThe Keg has been around for years, and they never disappoint. We've been to a few locations around the country and never had a disappointing meal there (truth).\n\nOkay, so about our evening.  \n\nARRIVING THERE:\nWe got there around 8 p.m. or so, and being a Saturday night, figured we'd have to wait a long time for a table. Nope. We were seated inside within a couple of minutes. We had the choice of the patio or inside, and we chose inside.\n\nLOCATION:\nThis particular property is located on the Esplanade in downtown Toronto, just east off Yonge St. and within walking distance to just about everything including Union Station, the Eaton Centre, Front Street, the Distillery District, the King Edward Hotel and the Harbourfront. It's a great location. There is public parking nearby as well. \n\nDECOR:\nThe Keg's decor is quite lovely ... low lighting, comfortable chairs and tables (or booths), fireplaces and an overall lovely vibe ... very relaxed yet at the same time you can see people are enjoying themselves. It's a nice environment.\n\nDRESS CODE:\nI'm not sure there is one - we saw people in jean shorts as well as some who were dressed up. I think the bottom line here is, don't look like slob and don't wear flip flops and you'll be okay. If you're not sure, give them a call and just ask. \n\nBAR:\nYes, there is a bar at the front of the restaurant and you can just go there for drinks and bar food if you like.\n\nMENU & FOOD QUALITY:\nThe menu is lovely - we always order the teriyaki classic, but there's lots to choose from - salmon, chicken, different kinds of steaks, a burger.  You won't leave your table hungry. \n\nThe wine list is extensive enough that it'll please everyone. They even have Canadian wines on their roster which, to me, is important. Canada has a great wine industry and it's nice to see our restaurants actively supporting them. \n\nThe Billy Miner pie is a classic Keg dessert and a must-have. \n\nThe Keg also gives you complimentary sourdough bread with butter with your dinner (they actually serve it a bit before while you're perusing the wine list!)  \n\nSERVICE:\nService is ALWAYS friendly and prompt, but they don't hover over you annoyingly.  If you tell them it's your birthday, they'll likely sing to you.  :) \n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nWith hundreds of locations around Canada, you won't have any trouble finding a Keg Steakhouse near you. Highly recommend this terrific restaurant chain. \n\nHappy dining.  :)More"", 'We visited The Keg on the Esplanade with family and a friend who was visiting from Australia.

Great place for couples. Our food was great. We had the peppercorn steak with veggies�. Which the veggies were a wide variety.  Amazing amount of veggies . Had the burger and it was juicy. Caesar salad...and mixed green salad were large and very good. Loved the vinaigrette on the garden salad.  It was very busy there so our table did feel wedged in between others.  Our server was friendly and constantly he king on us. However, their was a young man who ever time walked past us69 wipe down tables, left an unpleasant odour. I�m surprised his coworkers have not complained about this.  It was really strong and very offensive. But without that, it was a perfect dinner out.

We were in no rush but when another party were seated at the table next to us some 10 minutes later and were immediately offered drinks,...we did wonder.  We were then spotted by a passing host who came over and asked if everything was OK.  We said that we were still waiting so she took a drinks order and arranged for water to be brought to the table. We were then visited by a manager offering his sincere apologies for the delay and when we said we had not yet ordered food, he immediately brought a server to our table. From that point. The service was impeccable and the meal itself was great. The baked shrimp appetiser was delicious as was the filet mignon served with a twice baked potato.  We were then brought a complementary dessert which was also very nice although we were quite full so unable to finish it.  When the bill came, as another gesture of goodwill and by way of compensating for the initial delay in service, the cost of our wine was deducted.  Overall it was a great experience and we were surprised and genuinely appreciated the compensation given.More', 'This restaurant was booked by our travel operator so we didn�t know when to expect when bringing 10 teenagers on a school visit. \nRomana was wonderful, she engaged well with our students and made them feel relaxed and welcome. \nDoor staff (sorry I didn�t get...his name) joked on with our students as we left, fist pumped and chatted with them about their visit from the UK. \nFood was also incredible.More']"

We dine at Japanese restaurants a lot in the city and love sushi, so we decided to try the Kaiseki meal at Miku. This was an insult to the concept of Kaiseki...and the whole idea is fresh, seasonal ingredients. There was zero freshness in these ingredients. The sauces, seafood and accompaniments were completely off-putting to the point where we couldn\'t wait to get home to brush our teeth. The sauces were overpowering in their flavour and clumpy like you could tell they\'ve been sitting under heat lamps too long. The fish was ""fishy"" and not in a good way, and the seasoning of everything was rancid. Forget talking about cohesion of the dishes or creativity, this was low-quality ingredients prepared terribly and the restaurant charges you hundreds of dollars for this ""food"". If you\'re about to say ""maybe that was just the Kaiseki menu and you would\'ve done better with the sushi"", the meal had a sushi course and that\'s where I simply stopped eating because I was worried about getting sick. The ONLY good thing about this place was the service. Our waitress was very friendly and service was very swift, because everything was clearly pre-made ahead of time and that\'s why none of it was fresh. A waste of money and a disgrace to Japanese cuisine.More', 'Wrote a letter to the Manager.

After driving 2.5 hours to eat sushi in Toronto, this was incredibly disappointing. Perhaps we should have left at that time, however, we decided to stay since we had travelled.\n\nFor a restaurant reported to be �one of the best in the area�, it was rather austere with no ambiance or authenticy. Our waitress was less than engaging and value for dollar was lacking. My husband ordered the Sashimi �selection�. To receive a plate with 6 thin pieces of fish for 30.00 is outrageous. I ordered the Miku Signature Sushi selection which while tasty, was not worth the 38.00 dollars for 10 ordinary pieces of sushi. Not to mention the reaction I had later, as there must have been MSG in the food or sauce.\n\nFor a grand total of $85.00 ( including two green teas), this was the most disappointing sushi experience we have ever had and I assure you we have travelled extensively. We had to eat elsewhere afterwards to feel that we had had a decent meal. \n\nRegardless of any excuse that may be offered, surely you can agree that your patrons should be able to expect a more substantial meal and better overall experience.

I and the whole fam thought they were delicious. The tacos are loaded so very good value for money spent. The only thing I�d recommend is that they consider moving their condiments station.

When we made the reservations we were told to expect to be there for about 2 hours. We spent 2 and half hours there and it was like a really good movie that ends after 2 and a half hours...and you want more. The restaurant is about a month old so its very modern, quite nice and relaxing.  Since it was our first time we told how to order, all the dishes are shared. There was 5 of us so dishes like the cheeseburger spring rolls, which has two servings per order we were able to order 2 and half so we each had a piece. The slaw is incredible, which is what we started with, followed by the spring rolls, which had so many different flavours that came together just perfectly.  I'm not going to go through each plate we had but suffice it to say we had a hard time deciding which was our favourite.  Everything was so good plated like artwork. \nThe staff, you don't get just one waitress or waiter it seemed like the entire staff was waiting on us. New plates and utensils between each plate and they clean your table. \nVery very professional but not so much that its not friendly. \nWe absolutely loved it and if we lived in Toronto this would would definitely be a place that we would go to often.More"", 'Great new location, with an appealing modern decor - watch for the steps! Service was fantastic and it was nice to see Susur Lee visibly overseeing everything leaving the kitchen. Portion sizes were satisfying and the blend of flavours were fantastic. The braised beef melted...in your mouth, an excellent recommendation from our server. And, of course the famous signature slaw never disappoints! Definitely a wonderful choice for our special occasion celebration.More', 'Asian fusion cuisine at its best, from the Bao to the cheeseburger spring rolls, all dishes that we shared and can be adapted to more than the specified numbers were delicious.', ""We went to Lee for an intimate birthday dinner for two.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.\n\nThe new dining room is bright, airy and spacious.  Enough room between tables. No visible televisions.\n\nThe cocktails were superb.  I had a burnt orange Manhattan that ranks in the...top 10 I have ever had.  My friend had the special made to order sangria, which was equally good, although it had some crunchy bits that were hard to deal with at the end.\n\nWe had the Singapore Style Slaw, which is famous for all the right reasons.  We also had the Adobe Chicken Satay, which was tasty but quite a small portion (after the generosity of the Slaw!).  And our main was the Top Chef Curry Chicken Roulade, which melded so many flavours together.  And we finished with the Warm Molten Chocolate Cake and a cappuccino.   That was enough food for two people.\n\nThe only downside was the choice of utensils on some of the dishes.  We simply didn't have enough spoon power to get all of the sauces off the Roulade properly, and the Molten Chocolate Cake cried out for a fork or knife, but all we got was a huge spoon which couldn't cut it (pardon the pun).  The ice cream melted before we could deal with the Cake.\n\nAnd of course dinner for two with drinks came it at over $200.  But you get the fine dining experience for that price.  And I haven't even mentioned the service, which was professional, friendly, and fun.\n\nRecommended.  Make reservations!More"", 'We went here to celebrate Chinese New Year, because my partner is from China and she was curious to try it. I have been been here previously pre-pandemic and enjoyed it, but this time was a let-down. The server was super high pressure, pushing us...both to order the chef\'s tasting menu, which was around $130 each, and even from the server\'s description, was far too much food for one person (and it was). I think my date was intimidated into ordering it, and at first they didn\'t want to serve it to my date unless we each ordered it, which was ridiculous and the kind of high pressure nonsense that no restaurant should indulge in. I held my ground and the server came back a minute later and said they would make an exception. If you\'ve seen the Tru Kote scene with Jerry Lundegard in ""Fargo"", you know what I\'m talking about. I ordered a reasonable amount of food myself - maybe $60 worth of appetizers and a main course, so it wasn\'t like we were being cheap. Server hovered around the table constantly chit chatting and hustling was quite annoying and intrusive. Really ruined the food experience, which would have been good otherwise.More', 'The meals were absolutely perfectly done. Such an amazing experience for your palette. Service was prompt and extremely good.', 'We went on the very last night they were open on King St.  It was our first time there and the only problem with the menu was making a decision.  There were so many eclectic dishes to choose from.  The signature slaw appetizer could have...been a meal itself.  The cheeseburger spring rolls were messy but delicious.  The flavors in the entrees were plentiful and well balanced.  One entr�e we had was the slow braised beef and the other was a beef skewer special menu item.  All dishes are made to be shared among the table.\n\nThe service was okay.  We had made a reservation but were going to miss it due to traffic.  We called about 20 minutes before our scheduled time and let them know we were going to be 20 minutes late.  They said it was fine but it would cut into the max 2 hours we were allowed to be at the table.  We ended up being 30 minutes late and were welcomed and seated promptly.  We had drinks and the slaw appetizer in hand within 30 minutes of being seated.  There were lots of people working and things almost ran a little too efficient.  For example, the beer glass was not big enough to hold a whole can and when I finished topping up my glass and emptying the can, it was immediately taken away from the table.  \n\nIt was strange to me that the second appetizer came out at the same time as the entrees, after we had been clearly done with the slaw for several 5-10 minutes.  But fine, no problem, it was just a lot of new plates on our table at once.  We continued eating for the next 30-45 minutes and then with 10 minutes left in our 2-hour time window, things started to wrap up quickly.  For example, the beef skewers came with these spicy potato straw bites (also delicious).  I had the third-last forkful of potato straws in my mouth when the bowl was whisked away from me without anyone asking if we wanted to finish it or pack it up.  They were never to be seen again.  As soon as our last bites of our entr�es were in our mouth, the plates were taken away.  We were given our bill without being asked about dessert 5 minutes before our table time was expired.\n\nI understand we were 30 minutes late so I am not complaining about not having dessert or things moving so quickly.  However, some courtesy words could have been spoken.  Such as, ""because you were 30 minutes late, we aren\'t able to offer dessert today"" or ""we have to start clearing the table, would you like these potato straws in a to-go container"" or ""if you\'d like dessert, you can order it now and wait for it to-go at the front of the restaurant.""  But it wasn\'t even acknowledged at all.  Things just happened.\n\nAnyway, the food was amazing and worth the exorbitant cost.  The experience up to the last 15 minutes was great.  We will definitely return when it re-opens elsewhere... and be sure to arrive on time.More', 'Wonderful tasting food.  interesting signature  cocktails.  A little too dark  to appreciate whether or not the food was beautifully presented.  Background music, although well chosen, was a little too loud for easy conversation', ""Chef Sursur  presented an dining experience to remember. I have had this experience 5 maybe 7 times now and he never fails to impress.  The combinations and subtle notes of flavor are layered and present as more than the sum of their parts. He walks...you through a concert of flavors that in both combination and sequence tell a unique story.  The multi course dinner was a memorable experience.  Sursur's food is memorable for the good reasons, just take the time to appreciate the multi layered flavor and texture experience of it all.More"", 'Very good wait service, knowledgeable food and beverage staff, incredibly delicious food.  Our server was able to recite an extensive menu and when asked questions about it was able to make some very astute and delicious recommendations for food and wine.

Table was cleaned after each course, glasses where filled and fun was had by all.More', 'We went here for dinner on a weekday. The public underground parking is a very short away and had good flat rates for the evening.\nWe ordered the famous Singapore slaw which was amazing.

It was an absolutely fabulous experience. The service was flawless from the moment we stepped in to the restaurant and never once faltered. The hostess took our coats and walked us to our...table.  We were introduced to our waiter who offered us water and explained the menu and different options.  We, then, were given ample time to considered the menu.  Once we had decided on the tasting menu, the sommelier offered several selections to accompany our meal.  He was very knowledgeable and passionate about wine and quite happy to share his thinking.  The food was exquisite from start to finish.  Every course built in flavour from the previous one and was a clearly well thought through menu.  They were very happy to accommodate me in substituting vegetarian options for the fish courses, since I do not eat fish. Our waiter, Dylan, was amazing. He  described each course and recommended the best way to eat it to enjoy it to the fullest. He changed our plates between courses, kept our table neat, and was just delightful and discrete all evening (even offering tips on where to visit during our trip to South Africa since he is from there).More', 'The countdown is on for the final days of the restaurant. It�s been quite a long history of this restaurant in Toronto, and much to be proud of. However, that being said, over the last 15 years or so, the menu has not changed significantly,...and they have kept many of the same items. That being said, these tend to be the most popular items like the signature slaw, as well as the cheeseburger spring rolls. With all of the incredible new and unique places opening up in Toronto, it�s amazing that they have stayed open this long. Best wishes going forward.More', 'This is an outstanding fusion restaurant with a huge focus on food creativity and quality.

We tried the deep fried meatball which was tasty and ordered both of their specialties- the meat and cheese platter and the elephant ear pork cutlet as well as some additional entrees. Both of the specialties were...outstanding and should be ordered for the group. The huge pork cutlet was the biggest piece of pork you can imagine. The only disappointment was the passatelli ascuitti which was very, very dry and was served with too much grated parmesan. It could have used a more creamy sauce.More', 'I wish I could give this place a 4.5. The pasta was very good, especially the gnocchi. The squash ravioli was unique and flavorful as well. Our salad was supposed to have pork in it, but there were only two little shavings in the whole...bowl. They were also out of limoncello, which was disappointing, so we didn�t try any drinks. Would I go back? Sure. Are there better restaurants in Toronto. Absolutely.More', 'To begin with, you should know the difference between Northern and Southern Italian cooking before you go here. If you go to Stelvio simply because its an ""Italian"" restaurant, you might be disappointed. You won\'t find a tomato anywhere near this place.\n\nMy expectations were...high, due to social media, but one has to wonder where these 5 star reviews come from. More importantly. always read ""how many"" reviews were written by the review you are reading.  Also, I read several reviews about the pizza but they do not have that anymore and I find that that is a common direction for many fine Italian restaurants. \n\nMy quick summary is that the ambiance and the staff are wonderful. The food, not so much. We had the meatball appetizer or I should say the Mondeghili, which are flattened, deep-fried meatballs but it\'s difficult to taste any meat since the centre of this deep fried patty was more like a pate. It comes with an onion relish of sorts with a balsamic reduction. Overall it did nothing for our palettes.\n\nFor the main we had the Spezzatino Con Polenta and the Risotto alla Milanese con Ossobucco (as opposed to Osso Buco with Risotto), neither of which were up to the expectation built up for this restaurant.\n\nThe risotto was incredibly salty and somewhat crusted (maybe being exposed to air for too long) and not very ""creamy"", and the Osso Bucco, as I mentioned to our waiter was just ""sad"". A smallish portion with the bottom being tough like jerky. Now having had a similar meal a few months ago in Milan, I am not comapring this to that. But even for Toronto, it was just ""sad"".\n\nThe reason I gave this 3 stars is because of the staff. Dorian, a waiter from Belgium did his best to explain how the Osso Bucco was prepared and why the risotto was as salty as it was, and offered to get us something else. But we did not want to cause a ""fuss"". And if the replacement dish would not have been as good, then it would create an even ""sader"" evening.\n\nThe only thing that may have caused this experience is that we went on Valentine\'s Day. Maybe due to the 3-4 seatings on a busy evening, they had required meals to be prepared in advance or maybe the head chef was out for dinner himself. Either way, the food was no where near our expectation, even for a Northern Italian restaurant.\n\nOn the plus side, the wine (while very much over priced - 3x the LCBO) was good. However I was very much surprised they didn\'t have a Lambrusco which is very common in Northern Italy. Desserts were ok.More', 'Was there last June for probably the fifth time (was there both at their current location and their previous location at Queen St W). Great food, great atmosphere, first class service. Can highly recommend the Risotto alla Milanese with the Ossobuco.', ""The food was brilliant.  I went there specifically to have the Orecchia D'Elefante and I was not disappointed.  I�d definitely have it again.  But there are other dishes on the menu that I want to try so I guess I�ll be going back more than...once.  \n\nThe wait staff were incredibly charming.  Attentive without being overbearing.More"", 'Second time dining here for a special occasion and was not disappointed.  This time we got to try more of their unique to northern Italy dishes.  Both time I agreed with the others that the markup on their wine is ridiculously high.  We travel frequently...to Europe, so I just won\'t pay those prices and opted for a cocktail or two instead.

Excellent service as well as food and wine.More"", 'The wine is horribly overpriced, the food was served tepid at best and one of our meals arrived 10 minutes after everyone else�s with no apologies.\n\nThe pasta was hard not al dente and the portions are very small. \n\nThe pork chop was greasy, thin...and not pleasant.\n\nThe service was distinctly average.\n\nWe go out for dinner a lot to both cheap and high end restaurants and this is not good value for money - it�s very pretentious.More', 'I selected this restaurant for a dinner with family and friends based on the TripAdvisor rating.  We were expecting a great experience but found it average. \n\nThe appetizers were good but not great.  We had the saffron arancini, cheese and cured meat platters, and the...arugula salad.  The arugula salad was light, fresh and delicious, but the arancini was uneventful, bland and under seasoned. It sat in a tomato sauce that was so sparse it barely provided any flavour to the dish.\n\nAll six of us had pasta entrees - the dishes were under seasoned and uneventful.  The meat/raisin ravioli was strange and the flavours didn�t work together.  The meat sauce was almost non-existent on the classic tagliatelle bolognese, and the tagliatelle with mushrooms, truffle & sausage was cooked nicely, but bland. The gnocchi was good.\n\nThe wine menu is short but we found a nice wine at a reasonable price.\n\nWith the depth in the food scene in Toronto, either the TripAdvisor rating is unwarranted or we were there on an evening when the kitchen staff was on vacation.  This restaurant is not worthy of being in the top 500 (10%) let alone the top 15 restaurants!More', 'A quality experience with a selective menu (instead  of many forms of limp pasta with cream sauce and chicken or multiple pizza as in many ""Italian"" restaurants in Toronto). Starters included crushed potatoes stuffed with onion and chees) and for another dish sauteed spinach.  A...delightful listed salad with fennel was sold out and missed.  Mains included rabbit (delicious), Risotto with Ossobucco and another with sausage.  Various gnocchi were well received.\nVegetarians and glutton free were accommodated, no problem.  Location is fantastic in the Little Portugal part of old Toronto, the surrounding streets containing interesting hodgepodge of old small houses and Dundas Street is a vibrant place to be.

Now in a new location, it offers more space (important during COVID era) without losing any rustic elegance.\n\nThe Northern Italian fare is outstanding.

As tourists, we have discovered that it is highly recommended that you make reservations.  The only thing I found kind of bothersome...was when making reservations by the site Open Table they requested a credit card number.  This is probably due to the fact that people make reservations and don�t show up.  Sigh!  Apart from that we enjoyed our experience.  Service was excellent from being greeted until the end where the waiter held the door open for our departure.   Service was efficient and served in a timely manner.  Warm bread served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.  We ordered he lamb shank and seafood stew.  Really appreciated that food was served hot.  Generous portion for both dishes.  As we didn�t order any appetizers it gave us a bit of room for baklava.  We found that for the generous portions, it was a great value for this dining experience.

Well, better late than...never.\n\nWe\'ve been going to Banh Mi Boys since they opened their Queen St. W. location in 2011. We fell in love with their fusion style Banh Mi right from the get-go. Rather than cater only to the traditionalists, the Boys decided from the get-go to focus on hot meats from various cultures - including Korea, Japan and China - to stuff their gloriously crispy baguettes. We rocked the signature Five Spice Pork Belly, as well as the Kalbi Beef. As always the meats were delicious, and balanced perfectly with crispy carrots, crunchy jalapenos and super fresh, flavourful cilantro. Totally on point as usual.\n\nOh, and they also do non-banh mi items like bao and Korean tacos (killer). On this trip we shared a Five Spice Pork Belly Bao (because, pork belly!) as an ""appetizer"" - sooo good!\n\nIf you\'ve never gotten around to trying Banh Mi Boys now is as good a time as any to try.

I had the banger and mash and my wife had the liver.  So very yummy.  Our server was fantastic. This place was very lively.  We love it!', ""Let's get one thing straight -- my wife and I love House on Parliament. We're not locals (central Etobicoke, actually) but HoP has quickly become our go-to dine-in spot (I've written several glowing reviews on various platforms in the short time we've been dining there)....It was the last place we dined before Covid and the first to which we returned when things opened up. What keeps us coming back is the combination of delicious food prepared with skill and innovation, a terrific selection of drinks, and most importantly, the excellent service. Which is why our visit yesterday left us slightly out of sorts.\n\nThe food, as expected, was excellent and although the beer selection was a bit smaller than usual, I was able to find something to my liking. Where things fell down was on the service, specifically with our server. I won't mention him by name as I'm not out to embarrass or humiliate him, but we were extremely disappointed by his almost aloof attitude, his lack of attention to our needs, and his relative disinterest in our dining experience.\n\nSeated between a table of his regulars (with whom he seemed to make the time for idle chatter) and a large family group (which perhaps offered more in the way of gratuity) we were able to witness that he was indeed capable of conviviality when the mood suited. But for some reason, we were grossly overlooked (it's not as if the restaurant was overly busy). Other than taking our drink orders (in a rather rushed manner) and delivering the drinks and taking our food order, we barely interacted with him. I'm sure he's a decent fellow but as far as customer service goes, I think he's lost sight of the customer in the equation. And as I think of it, my first review back in 2019 mentioned that the service was a bit lacking and I'm almost sure it was the same person.\n\nThankfully, he seems to be an anomaly. The saving grace was the exemplary service delivered by his colleagues. The server who brought us our food (we didn't get his name) was friendly and polite, engaging in short but genuine conversation. The standout, however, was Julia, who not only noticed that I was trying to get the attention of our official server, but approached me and asked if I'd like another beer (even noting the specific brand I was drinking). We were quite impressed and wished we could have directed our tip to her alone. She also cleared our plates and checked in a couple of other times. Now THAT is superior service!\n\nFor the casual reader of these reviews, don't be put off. House on Parliament remains a stellar establishment for all the reasons I mentioned in the introduction and is well worth the trip. But for the management, if you're interested in discussing this matter further, I'm sure we can arrange a private chat.\n\nHaving said that, keep up the great work. We WILL be back.More"", 'Indoor and outdoor dining is available.This place has a good vibe. The vodka smoked salmon is a luscious mix of taste, texture, creaminess and saltiness.

They also sell their famous tomato jalapeno chutney by the jar that goes well with everything!More', 'After a stroll through the Old Cabbagetown section of Toronto, my wife and I found the perfect place to relax, unwind and stuff our faces beyond recognition. \n\nHouse on Parliament is a busy yet welcoming gastropub that serves elevated pub grub raised to a high...level. \n\nFor an appetizer, my wife and I shared the Wild Boar, Pheasant, and Cognac Scotch Egg, served with Branston Pickle, grainy mustard, and Baby Arugula. The seasoning was perfect, the flavours, mouthwatering. I would have maybe preferred the yolks a bit less cooked but that�s hard to achieve in a scotch egg. All in all, an amazing starter. \n\nFor my main, I had one of the daily specials: Moroccan Braised Lamb Shank, in red wine, apricot, roasted tomato, sun-dried black olives and mint; just look at that list of ingredients � they did not let me down! The dish was served with a side of polenta which I expected to be nothing more than plate-filler but ended up being rich and decadent and full of buttery goodness. More, please. The only downside was the vegetable side � not the choice or preparation, but the promise. Grilled asparagus was advertised but I got roasted Brussels sprouts instead. Though they were fantastic, I found it odd that a daily special substituted the veg without even a mention from the server. Luckily I like sprouts � but what if I had not�\n\nMy wife had one of the other specials: Great Lakes Monty�s ESB Braised BBQ Beef Ribs with Chipotle Bourbon BBQ sauce, Frites, and Coleslaw. I managed to pinch a taste from her plate and while the portions were ample and the flavours satisfying, I might have like a bit more imagination shown in the braising sauce other than BBQ. But all in all, another winning dish.\n\nA good meal can only be made better by a good beverage accompaniment and House on Parliament has a diverse selection of draft beers along with a couple of ciders (one of which suited my wife�s tastes perfectly � the Niagara No. 1 Dry Cider). I settled on the GoodLot Bock Bock, a malt-forward lager, with a slight caramel sweetness and a mild hoppy bitterness. Very moreish.\n\nService was friendly but not overly attentive; the restaurant did have a constant flow of patrons to keep the staff hopping so it�s somewhat understandable. But what sets a restaurant apart for us is not just the food, but the service. An establishment can sink or swim on that, alone.\n\nHaving said that, I�d like to give House on Parliament the benefit of the doubt on this one as it�s definitely a winner. Great atmosphere, great food and drink, and a positive buzz of energy that complements the experience rather than drowns it out. We�ll definitely be back!More', 'Our first time coming on a Sunday and they hit it out of the park again. Wonderful cozy neighbourhood pub, unfortunately not our �hood�. So we make a point of finding our way there as often as possible. Always a positive vibe and a buzz...with the happy chatter of friends and families enjoying great pub food. Service is attentive, fun and organized to keep the orders coming. Our usual smoked salmon appetizer was excellent and I have never found another place to top how they serve this with their red onion jam, soooo good! The lamb shank was tender and flavoured with middle eastern spices. The prime rib was perfectly cooked to medium rare (as ordered) with a ample serving of mashed potatoes and large Yorkshire pudding and flavourful au jus. The carrots and asparagus were perfectly cooked and served hot. I have noted some reviews complain that it is the same old menu. I find that they do keep some staple favourites on the menu (thank goodness) but do offer other specials which they change up just enough to keep it interesting. We also noted this time that the chalk boards that usually list their brews, were replaced with artistic renditions depicting Canadian themes artistically created by one of their staff. Nice touch. It will always be on our list to come here. Great team work to deliver delicious food and keeping the patrons happy.More', ""This is a very busy restaurant with a friendly fun staff.

The ceviche dish was very good, we both liked it. The kebab was very delicious, we both really liked this. The salad we ordered was forgotten and brought quite a while after we checked on it. Overall, the slow service and mixed quality of dishes makes this a good restaurant, not great.More', 'Horrible experience \n\nDined here with four friends last Friday. Most of us have been to Byblos before and loved the food. We started out with a bottle of wine, cocktails and appetizers. Everything was great, as was our waiter Cody. We had just started on...the second round of dishes when I noticed a caterpillar crawling out on the table. We alerted a waiter who apologized and got rid of it and sent over the bar manager Tyler. Tyler offered us a complimentary dessert. We had lost our appetites at that point and declined. Tyler offered to remake the dishes but we also said no and just asked that no other courses be sent out. About five minutes later, the two pides were served. Again we asked that they be removed and Tyler brought the bill which had several of the half eaten courses and food we didn�t even touch. Tyler stated he would remove the appetizers. We were pretty taken aback at this point seeing as the appetizers were the only thing we had actually finished at that point. By this time Tyler had been back and forth to our table several times and his demeanour was very rude. Several times we were asking questions and he�d speak while walking away from us. We suggested we pay for the apps, wine and cocktails. He said he�ll call his manager to see what he could do about the bill. We waited approximately 40 mins for him to return and tell us that the bill had not changed and if we still didn�t want to pay, he would call the police. I�m not sure why he felt the situation needed to be escalated to that point. We waited patiently, didn�t disturb other diners, and definitely had no intention of not paying for what we ate. It was the most insulting service I have ever had. Instead of creating a scene with police in the restaurant, we took a card and got the managers name, Matt, and paid hundreds of dollars for food we didn�t eat. On the way out, we stopped to talk to another waiter, Jordan, who honestly saved our night. He was gracious and apologetic and took the time to actually speak to us respectfully. The issue isn�t even the bug in the food, it was the attitude of the bar manager, Tyler. It�s unfortunate that one person could ruin a great night at a restaurant but the management was appalling and I would never return or recommend it.More', 'DESPICABLE SERVICE. BYBLOS DOWNTOWN DOES NOT VALUE CLEANLINESS OR CUSTOMER SERVICE.\n\nShort story: we found a LIVE caterpillar in our food. Tyler, the closing manager, threatened that if we didn\'t pay for the food that we DID NOT consume he would call the police. As...racialized women, we felt we had no choice but to pay the bill.\n\nLong story: The evening started off great with wine and apps.   We had just started the second course when we noticed a caterpillar had crawled out of one of the dishes. We didn\'t know which dish so we immediately all stopped eating. We quickly caught the attention of a passing server and they removed the caterpillar and escalated the situation to the manager. Tyler was the only manager available to ""assist"" us.  Right off the bat he was unapologetic and tried to offer us a complimentary dessert. We communicated to him that we had lost our appetite and did not wish to continue dining; despite this, a third course was brought to the table. We communicated to Tyler AGAIN that we did not want to continue with our dinner. He removed the dishes and brought the bill. We assumed that Byblos, a well-established restaurant, would not charge us for the dishes we did not consume/had a bug in it.  Any other restaurant in Toronto would have removed those items from the bill, at the very least, or would have comped us for the entire meal. However, when the bill arrived, it included half of the second course, which we never consumed, and he stated that he had \'waived\' the third course (which came after we communicated that we didn\'t want to dine there) as an ""apology"" for our experience (it\'s not an apology when you remove items from the bill that shouldn\'t have been on the bill in the first  place). He stated that mistakes happen and this was the best he could do. He refused to remove those items and we escalated the matter further. He spoke to the manager (Matt) who was offsite. We waited patiently for 45 minutes (we could have easily walked out but we didn\'t). When Tyler returned he provided us with the exact same bill and said that we either had to pay the bill or that he would call the 52 division for non-payment. We were all shocked that he threatened to call the police, especially because we were more than happy to pay for what we consumed. What started as an unfortunate mistake turned into a despicable customer experience. A simple apology and waiving of unconsumed food, which was completely at the fault of Byblos, would have de-escalated the situation. Instead, we were subject to unnecessary threats, including being followed and forced out of the restaurant. We will be making a formal complaint to Dinesafe Toronto and will never be dining at Byblos again.More', 'Byblos was amazing. Our server was excellent. The food was some of the best I have ever had and I have eaten all over the world and the mix of flavours was unbelievable.

Those dumplings were quite unlike any dumplings we�d ever had before, and amazing. The beet salad was a little more �eh,� but the lentil pide more than made up for that.\n\nOh, and the chocolate olive oil cake!! Get that. You must get that! \n\nOverall, the combination of flavors and textures was just out of this world.\n\nSince the Wretched Vegetarian also doesn�t drink, the only drink that was taken, alas, was a citrus gin cocktail, which was perfect for my taste.\n\nWill definitely be back here the minute we�re in Toronto again, and we�ve already recommended it to many people.More']"

Every single dish is pretty spectacular. The service is always top notch and the cocktails ...don't get me started on the cocktails...so creative and delicious!More"", 'Great experience. Food and service was excellent. Gorgeous taste and presentation. We took a tasting menu with five courses. Of course there are options a la cart . For us it was plenty.', 'Before proceeding with my review, based on tonight�s memorable and enjoyable experience, I would just like to comment on the couple of 1 and 2 stars rating which I came across in recent food-blog reviews that prompted me to say ... � What the hack...made those reviewers post such ridiculous BS?! Guess they must be eating under the influence of local anesthetics that had not worn off, after seeing their dentist?! �\n\nBack to the meal!\n\nPrior to Alo�s arrival at the Toronto food scene, for the past two decades, George and (ex) -Splendido had been my two most favorite �French-themed� restaurants in town. Both feature tasting menus with wine pairing and both with gifted students of legendary master-chef Anton Mossiman at the helm�..Lorenzo Loseto and David Lee.\n\nAfter an acclaimed two decades, Chef Loseto - winner of the 2014 � Gold medal plate Canadian Culinary competition �, is still heading the kitchen at George. Not only did this gastronomic stalwart manage to beat out and survive the pandemic scare and shutdown, it is currently in full swing and going strong. Its creative and talented chef and kitchen continue to deliver eye-appealing and delectable culinary fare to the tables.\n\nThis evening, with the help of GPS and braving smog and haze, not to mention the notorious rush hour, downtown traffic and Queen street construction, we miraculously arrived safely at our venue destination. I, with raised adrenaline levels and my eating-partner driver with sweaty palms!\n\nIn the past, for our multi-course tasting menu, my dining partner and I have always been served a separate and different dish during the course of our dinner�..a 7+ course meal for two resulting in an array of 14+ different dishes/preparations. That was fun and showcased the skill and creativity of Chef Loseto and his team. However, the approach also created conflict, dilemma and disappointment for us, in that, in a few instances, one of us was served dishes with ingredients that the other person fancied and vice-versa.\nTherefore, for tonight�s dinner. to play safe and to avoid disappointment and jealousy, we have requested ahead of time that IDENTICAL dishes of the same course be served to both my partner and myself. This approach also allows us to compare notes of the same dish.\n\nTonight�s menu approach: We decided to place our gastronomic journey and fate at the hand of Chef Loseto. His multi-faceted, fusion Omakase menu ended up with a superb and imaginative 9 course feast. The dishes include:\n\nAmuse bouche: Stuffed Zucchini Flower Tempura\nAppetizers: Tuna Tataki Wrap\nWhite Asparagus with crudo marinated Hamachi\nSeafood courses: De-constructed Dungeness Crab Cake\nChar-grilled Octopus\nMeat course: Wagyu Beef wrapped grilled Romaine Lettuce\nSeared Foie Gras with Roasted Squab\nMain course: Seared and roasted Venison Rack\nCheese course: Ashley Goat Cheese and Mountain oak cow�s milk Cheese\nDessert course: Alberobello chocolate and salted caramel Gelato\nCherry, Mascarpone, Mango Mousse Cake\n\nWow! What a surprise and what a meal! The first impression of many dishes were eye-appealingly pretty and busy in a psychedelic way�..an edible Joan Miro Painting?! However to our amazement and surprise, the combined ingredients and products somehow yielded a harmonious mouth feel and taste profile!....a reflection of the chef�s skill and understanding of the various components and elements used!\n\nOf all the dishes presented, the perfectly cooked, �oh-so-delicious� Venison dish rose head and shoulder above the rest and really made my evening! Coming in a close second was the Foie Gras and Squab dish. Again, the main components of this dish were perfectly executed. So many honorable dishes worth mentioning, they included the White Asparagus and Hamachi, the smoky Chargrilled Octopus, the deconstructed Crab Cake, the Mascarpone Mango mousse cake�..etc. IMHO, a more lenient Michelin inspector would have given George a star?!\n\nLastly, a special thank you to our friendly, warm, attentive and professional server - �Ryan�, who kept us entertained in between dishes, due to a packed house tonight!More', 'Came here for our anniversary dinner and we were blown away.  Everything from the service to the wine selection through to the food experience to atmosphere exceeded our expectations.  My wife and I opted for the 7 course meal each which offered us 14 different...dishes, we were blown away.  Only one was not to our liking, but that was personal preference (lamb) and nothing to do with preparation or presentation.  We will definitely be back and highly recommend for a complete dining experience.More', 'It�s a very nice place with pleasant ambience  and a pretty upscale and friendly service. \nHowever, the food is pretentious, but average at taste and it is simply not worth the money.\nI wouldn�t recommend this restaurant.', ""It's been some years since I came to this flagship Toronto restaurant but it's quality has not changed, except maybe it's even better if that's even possible.  Each course is so expertly prepared that exploring the plate is half the fun--so many components! Each complimenting...the other.  Perfect duck, scallops in a carrot dashi and with such a pretty topping of micro herbs and edible flowers, it looked like high art.  Halibut cooked to buttery perfection and a ribeye with amazing depth of beefy flavor.  Potato pave, herb bundles wrapped in a thin slice of cucumber and with a buzz of chili oil . . . each bite an explosion!   Meals are seldom this good as the chef keeps setting the standard for everyone else.More"", 'This was our second experience at George Restaurant. The first time we went was 11 years ago on our first trip. The food and experience was just as good as we remembered. Its really a one of kind experience that is perfect for a date...or special occasion. The service, food and wine was all top notch!More', ""We were very disappointed with our evening. The service was terrible.  We ordered a la cart and had to wait almost an hour for our second course. We were not in a rush since we were celebrating our 40th anniversary.  However,   the third course was...brought before the second and it was then suggested to us that we could have our second after our main!!!\nWe won't be back.  Sad, since this used to be one of our favourite restaurants.More"", 'This is a magic place on the restaurant map of Toronto. There is no a single weak point at George. Elegant but not too poshy design, superb professional service and tasty and surprising menu. Our waiter Robert H was so professional that he deserves a...gold medal for being a great salesman and � a somelier, as his knowledge about wines (and overall service itself) was outstanding.\nFood was gorgeous. Starting from tasty amous bouche - which at this evening was at this evening a fantastic chipotle mayo based stuff, followed by duck with super tasty raspberry or (as my wife had a different choice) avocado creme brulee (!!!).

Great ambience and impeccable service. All of this helped create the best atmosphere for a business dinner.', 'George is located on Queen St East, kind of a run down area, but once you enter it�s understated front doors you are in a warm inviting space. There�s a tasting menu or a la carte options. We had the tasting menu and it did...not disappoint. Each dish was flavourful and creative, ranging from raw tuna to delicious pork belly. There are also wine pairings or you can order from their well stocked cellar. The bar can craft an excellent cocktail or mocktail for you. Service is friendly and first rate with smooth timing between dishes. Reservation recommended.More', 'The service and food is something that cannot be missed. We did the 10 course menu which had spectacular flavors and perfect service with attention every detail.', 'We were a party of 3 and selected their 10 plate tasting menu � two standard and one vegetarian.  The service, the plating and food were all outstanding.  A very memorable evening.  A great experience that we highly recommend.', 'Chef Loseto�s philosophy is guided by using the highest quality of seasonal, natural and sustainable food.  His passion and inspiration create beautifully prepared and exquisite cuisine.  All 4 of us had the 7-course tasting menu and two of our party had the wine pairings.  Every...component that made up each dish we had married beautifully with everything on the plate.  Each course was unique and beautifully presented�all of us loved every course. Each couple was presented two different dishes and thus by sharing we were able to enjoy 14 dishes. It was fun to be able to sample these additional dishes. Chef Loseto and his team have created an extraordinary dining experience.\n\nOur Sommelier, Stephen who is also the General Manager contributed to making our dining at George an enjoyable one. We appreciated Stephen telling us about each of the wines that accompanied each course.  His friendly personality and extensive knowledge of the wine and his willingness to share that knowledge made for a wonderful dining experience.  We also want to thank Rob for his attentiveness to our table.  His professional and friendly service was greatly appreciated.\n\nDiscover what a passionate, inspirational and creative Chef and his team have to offer and enjoy a memorable dining experience.More']"

Got the Keg Classic with a Caesar Salad, Prime Rib, Cauliflower Mash.  Caesar was bland with watery...dressing. Cauliflower Mash was ice cold.  I swear they scooped it straight from the refrigerator and no one heated it. Quality of Prime Rib itself was good but it was flavorless, no crust, and just uninspired.  I sat at the bar.

We ordered the baked Brie which was excellent. The basil sauce and jelly was a great combination with the tostini bread. \n\nFor mains we had the peppercorn New York with grilled shrimp added on and Steak & Shrimp.  Also kids steak and chicken strips. \n\nThe New York was covered in whole peppercorns. It�s not bad, but not what I was expecting either. It was a little strong for my taste. The whiskey sauce pairing is not at all what I expected.  If you�re American I would liken it to brown gravy you find on a pot roast - not au jus though. I couldn�t discern the whiskey flavor either.  The honey sauce that came with the kids strips was what I ended up using to dip my steak In. It was cooked to the perfect temp and presented nicely. \n\nThe grilled shrimp were excellent though.

However, the other part of menu was very irregular and not to the standards expected, some of the dishes were just not well executed. I ordered the tune and shrimp special and tuna was overcooked, and the rest of the dish  was a hot mess. We ordered clams and they were not good either. Ceviche with scallops was really pleasant, the right acidity and the scallops were super fresh. I would also remark their wine selection, having interesting bottles especially in the white section. The atmosphere is very casual and some tables can be very small for4 people, so ask what type of table you are getting to ensure you don�t spend the night cramped. Desserts are nothing to mention.

Given the restaurant's exceptional ratings and menu prices, my expectations were quite high when it came to both the food and the service.\n\nTo my disappointment, the food turned...out to be rather average. The appetizers and main dishes were passable, but considering it's a steakhouse, one would anticipate outstanding steak options. My kid ordered the rack of lamb and after just three bites, declared her dislike for it. We ended up swapping plates, and I couldn't help but agree; the meat had a slightly gamey taste. Most of our group reached a similar consensus, the place was OK at best.\n\nThe service left much to be desired as well. It was slow and lacked attentiveness. Given that this was a family dinner, we were a bit chatty initially and took some time to look at the menus.

The lobster in the shell was put on top of the spaghetti. Which should be separate because the sauce got all over the lobster making it messy. She brought the lobster cuter but didn�t bring the tiny fork. Things were lacking with the service. The server had to be reminded of the cake for the Birthday. But she was friendly and apologetic.

My husband ordered the papardelle and the description that�s on the menu doesn�t describe exactly what you really get. I thought it was going to be in a white sauce with some pieces of meat in it with the pasta.

My freinds husband ordered the short ribs and his plate was huge pieces of meat but I don�t know how it tasted. My sister and her husband ordered a salad, some grilled seafood and a pizza.

Once inside we were seated to our table quickly and giving our menus.  Though they have other dishes, schnitzel is the go to here for good reason. After ordering our bottle of Hungarian red wine we ordered 2 orders of their famous hungarian goulash soup as a appetizer, which was enough for all five of us to try. Brought over in a cast iron pot, it was nicely seasoned with hungarian paprika and full of dumplings and vegetables and seasoned tender beef. This was a winner and a great start. Next came our house platters for 2. Huge platters of different schnitzels along with rice, fried potatoes, red cabbage, fried mushrooms, cabbage rolls and sausage. Everything was delicious - the schnitzel was melt in your mouth tender and the portions were huge. We had enough food left over for full dinners the next day - well worth the $75.

Food came in a timely fashion and all dishes were good. If I could make one recommendation it would be for the chef to use more seasoning in their dishes. Perhaps Hungarian food is meant to be bland, but I think some seasoning would elevate their food.\n\nI was hoping for roast potatoes with some kind of Hungarian flare, but unfortunately they were essentially home fires that were deep fried with no seasoning.\n\nWe also tried the home made Apple Strudel. While it was good, like other dishes it needed something more. Wasn�t very sweet and needed more cinnamon perhaps.\n\nOverall a good meal and experience but there is room to elevate the food to the next level.

We shared a good portion of Carmelina's home-made tiramisu with Spanish Coffee.  This was a VERY SPECIAL night (my girlfriend turned 28 .... I hope she doesn't kill me for revealing her age ... LOL). We will not hesitate to come back over and over  as our night turned out to be absolutely and totally wonderful than we could have expected. I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this place.

Gelato was offered but when asked all the restaurant had was gelato served as a chocolate raspberry tartufo.  The tiramisu was a disappointment.

Terra has always been a beautiful place and although the Chef�s Table...is a cozy, private room it would�ve nice if it was a little less �cozy.�  By that I mean the distance of the chairs to the walls is pretty small so you are constantly having to move your chair inwards to allow staff to get past you to serve water�wine�food etc.  Not a deal breaker but a little annoying to always be shuffling your chair positions. Service was very good and most of the food got rave reviews.  The raw oysters�calamari�squash soup�bone marrow�Shrimp Diablo and Caesar salad were all delicious as were the mains of Portobello mushrooms�Arctic Char�Assorted seafood�Ostrich and the New York strip with the calamari and strip steak being standouts.  There were a couple of misses�ironically on the easiest entr�e to prepare and the most expensive item on the menu.  My friend ordered the Seafood Spaghettini but asked to sub Rigatoni pasta instead.  Unfortunately the pasta was under cooked and crunchy. Not el dente'...el crunche'. Poorly cooked pasta should not happen at a restaurant of Terra�s quality.  On the other end of the spectrum I ordered 4 oz. of the Wagyu beef medium rare and most of it was inedible.  There was so much gristle�not fat�hard, rubbery gristle�on the slices that I�m shocked whoever prepared and sliced the beef would serve it because the gristle was very tough to cut and impossible to chew.  I informed our waitress and she was very apologetic and informed the manager who came and apologized as well.  Everything was handled properly and the Wagyu was removed from the bill but again, a high end protein at a high end restaurant shouldn�t be treated like that.  For my appetizers I ordered the Caviar and the Oysters Rockefeller.  I was told the Rockefeller was not available so I subbed in 6 raw oysters.  As I finished the caviar our server returned and said that Oysters Rockefeller WAS available so she brought me my original order.  I found the oysters very dry�the topping was firm and crispy�not the usual moist flavour bomb of butter and spinach.  It was OK�I know chefs like to add their own twist to traditional recipes�but I prefer the taste of the original. The cocktails were very good and so were the desserts.  Overall everyone really enjoyed their experience at Terra and I know I�ll be back in the future.More"", 'We wanted a private party during pandemic without distractions. The chef�s room was dark but perfect for 8 (up to 12). The best thing about Terra is the service. Iris took care of every detail. The food was good�better than Sarpa�s (surpassed their customer care...too). We enjoyed her recommendations: 2 appetizers (buffalo cheese went well with the bread & calamari); 1 Caesar salad; 2 famous seafood spaghetti; 1 tender roast chicken; 2 small steaks; 2 x$45 char fish; and a gnocchi. With three cocktails and a plating fee ($5 each for sliced birthday cake) the total including 20% gratuity was $735. All of the staff wore masks, although guests weren�t expected to wear one. Until the patio opens, the chef�s room is a solution to party planning with seniors for pandemic peace-of-mind. Servings are rather small yet not salty. One thing though: the place is not wheelchair/accessible, and getting in/out of the restaurant or washroom stalls can be tricky due to heavy doors. There�s no view, but parking is free outside beside Philoxenia Greek restaurant. The address is listed wrong, as the entrance is on the Markham (not Vaughan) side of Thornhill. I would book early as there�s one chef�s room, and look for the red Christmas lights under a dentist sign; Terra�s easy to miss but the entrees spot on!More', 'We had our office Christmas dinner at Terra and we would not have been more pleased. \n\nThe ambiance is extraordinary and the service exceeded our expectations.

We were expecting to sit on the back patio but instead were placed in the front by the parking lot.  Our first time there, we didn\'t realize the beauty of the back patio until we had gone to the washroom.  Why weren\'t we given the choice when we arrived?  The first thing you notice when you are seated is that service is very slow.  The waiter came to the table to ask if we wanted bread (we didn\'t) and then disappeared for a while.  It took a good 15 minutes to take the drink orders and at the same time we ordered dinner.\nDrinks:  Cocktails are in the $15 to $17 range and are advertised (in the menu) as having 1.5 oz. of liquor.  I had a pomegranate margarita but could not taste the liquor.  My husband had a raspberry martini and couldn\'t taste the liquor.  Overpriced for fruit juice?  We then waited for our first course - a green salad which we shared.  It came already on two plates, was an ample size and very tasty with a light dressing and a good variety of greens.  We then waited for our mains.  I had the Branzino fillet which came perfectly done on a bed of greens (mainly asparagus which were perfectly cooked while my husband had Crackling Over-roasted Chicken, with lovely crisp skin and tender and juicy flesh also on a bed of greens perfectly cooked.  I thought my fish was a tad too peppery but that is a personal taste.  We started at about 7:15 p.m. (on a Sunday night) and by the time we had finished our mains, it was 9:30!  I wanted a up of decaf and we asked that our bill be brought at the same time.  We waited about 10 more minutes for the coffee and the bill.  Knowing it was my birthday, they brought a dish of a few biscotti and some cookies on a beautifully decorated plate.  Then we waited a bit longer for the waiter to bring the machine so we could pay.  All in all, the meal was beautifully served, tasty and the wait staff were friendly.  But  the service was very slow.  I also thought that the prices were a bit over the top. If you want a leisurely meal and you\'re prepared to sit for 2 1/2 hours, this is a good place, but be sure to ask for the rear patio.More', ""I wish I can talk about the food, only the service.

The chicken was decent.  The interesting Thai like salad was good. My biggest complaint was my friend that ordered the beet salad with added shrimp.  The beet salad was $18 dollars. Understandable but steep for possibly two (2) beets.  Most offensive was the $30 surcharge for the shrimp. Although four shrimps were offered the price could of purchased two pounds.    \nWe didn�t order coffee or desert as we where concerned with the time it would take.

We ordered a Lamb dish ($19) and a Chicken Biryani...($17) dish. I was shocked when the food arrived. The Lamb curry dish was SO small (Probably worth $2-3 to prepare), came with nothing else (Rice would have been nice) and the Biryani was enough for two people. Food did taste nice but I felt it was overpriced for the amount we got. When I mentioned the expensive cost to the Waiter, his reply was the the Rent for the place was expensive and someone has to pay higher prices to cover the rent, Really???? What a rude waiter. I told him, I was not there to pay the rent of the place. Nevertheless, I will never patronized this place again.More', 'Worst restaurant ever. Stupid policies. Ruined the experience. Never ever go there. Bad bad bad never recommended.', 'My family recently went to this restaurant and figured I should write a review as we were blown away at this place! So, let\'s break it down...\n\n1. Location - it\'s easy to get to. close to the highway exits, and plenty of parking. Having...2 small kids - we didn\'t find it an issue. Mind you - it was Sunday at noon - so that may have factored into it. Unsure of how that area is on weekdays/weeknights/weekend nights.\n\n2. Food - when you\'re asked ""where should i go and have Indian food"" - the Host is generally a top answer. I\'ve frequented the downtown location was ok with their food - however, trying this location out - and I\'m quite wowed by it. They serve your main Indian food - curries, tandoori, naans, rice, etc. However, they go the extra mile with a chaat/bhel station - where the guy is making it FRESH for you! They also have a freshly made gilibi (indian sweet) station - FRESH!! The turnover of food is really great here as lots of people eating and the food was definitely FRESH! Just one thing - I felt the tandoori chicken was a bit too \'saucy\' vs. dry. This is my personal preference though .. the chicken was still really great!! Take note to others - take the tandoori chicken and then put some of the butter chicken sauce on top - it\'s a win win!\n\n3. Drinks - my wife had a lassi and I was able to try it. It\'s really good their mango lassi... I on the other hand ordered a coke - to future visitors - don\'t order carbonated drinks at a buffet if you want to maximize your value! LOL\n\n4. Desserts - usual suspects. However, what blew us away was the fresh gilibi station. A must! \n\n5. Kid Friendly - as I mentioned - two young kids.... and they loved it! They don\'t like spicy food - and we actually didn\'t find the food spicy (ok, maybe a dish or two but generally not too spicy like other places we\'ve frequented). We had our table in the back room - so, there was plenty of space for our group. The servers were really nice with our kids too - much appreciated.\n\n6. Service - no complaints there. They came seeing if we wanted anything, and cleared our plates regularly. Really genuine and nice people and service.\n\n7. Bathrooms - Clean! My little boy had to frequent it a few times - and everything was fine for him. I wasn\'t disgusted like other Indian restaurants I have gone to before.\n\n8. Price - reasonable. We went on a Sunday - i think it was like $21/adult - but worth it considering the many choices, and freshness of the food. \n\nSo - reflecting back and reading my review - definitely positive. I usually like to give some \'criticism\' or suggested areas of improvement - and unfortunately, I don\'t have any - we had a great experience. Thank you The Host! Will be back again someday (unfortunately - it is a bit further from our hose to frequent regularly)!More', 'My family went for buffet lunch. There were lots of options.

I booked our special evening on Monday Dec 7th and it was a surprise to her as she has not been there...before. I did notice that the patio extension was done up very nicely and welcoming. Our server was very professional and attentive. His knowledge of the menu was spot on and recommended the best wine to go with which mains. We thought that it would be a great idea to share a few appetizers. Crispy calamari is my girlfriend's favourite. It was cooked to perfection ... crispy, hot and tender. Buratta is a fresh buffalo mozzarella served with ripe tomatoes, arugula, smoked salmon in a pesto olive oil .... YUMMY !!! We shared a portobello mushroom salad with goat cheese. These starters were fantastic and couldn't wait for our choice of mains to come. I had a mixed grill (I am a meat lover) of rack of lamb and veal chop. Medium rare is what I asked for and low and behold, it was done perfectly. My girlfriend ordered the seafood Newberg (a selection of shellfish). It had lobster tail, shrimps, scallops in a saffron white wine fish broth cream sauce. The seafood was done just right. Not dry, not overdone BUT fresh, juicy and tender .... PERFECT DISH !  Oh and by the way, the wines recommended with our meals were exemplary. This may sound like a lot of food but we made sure we had room for dessert. We shared a good portion of Carmelina's home-made tiramisu with Spanish Coffee.  This was a VERY SPECIAL night (my girlfriend turned 28 .... I hope she doesn't kill me for revealing her age ... LOL). We will not hesitate to come back over and over  as our night turned out to be absolutely and totally wonderful than we could have expected. I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this place. The patio looked magical with twinkling mini lights.

All came in great portions and all tasted very good.\nThe meals include two choices for dessert, Tiramisu or tartufu . Our party ordered both and both were good.\nOur server, Louie was very attentive and friendly.

The food was very good.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  The portions were generous.  The risottos were delicious.  It was also greatly appreciated that allergies to certain foods was accommodated by the chef.  The only drawback was the...limitation in the dessert menu.  Gelato was offered but when asked all the restaurant had was gelato served as a chocolate raspberry tartufo.  The tiramisu was a disappointment. It was soggy and definitely not worth the $9.00 price.  The only other thing I wanted to point out is that on the website they offered a $40.00 prix fixe menu.  This was not presented in the menu at the restaurant.\nOverall, it was a nice dining experience.  The staff were very friendly.  The atmosphere was nice.  It was not perfect (i.e. dessert) but I would consider going back again in the future.More', 'It was a seafood day. Our platters were full of what appeared to be a big assortment of seafood. But, after dissecting the selection, it turned out to have a lot of mussels and a few other selections. In the end all was okay', 'We had reason to have two meals in the last 1.5 weeks at the restaurant.  Both were really excellent.  The service was outstanding and so friendly.  The food is really good.  I especially like the risottos.  The grilled calamari appetizer is so good.  Decent selections...of wines at modest prices.  We definitely keep coming back.More', 'We visited this place on Friday and we had a really great evening. The food was delicious and the drinks were amazing.

The stir fried flat rice noodles with egg and beef was a surprisingly good dish.  Some of their ""steamed rice rolls"" are excellent too, but beware the portions are huge.

It won\'t hurt to smile.More', 'Even though it was NOT late, and there were no patrons waiting for a table, the impatient waiters expected an order as we were just sitting down. And they came back every minute for the order. Questions about the menu were not answered, they were...simply deflected. The food was delivered quickly but without any interest or pleasantness. The Spice and Pepper Squid was just OK. Shrimp Wonton Soup was very bland.

This is a very presentable Asian restaurant.  \n\nMy only negative comment is about the noise level - especially if you are seated near the dirty dish station!

He opens early and the prices are very reasonable! Worth the drive! Not much parking and seating is very limited.', 'Great food and very reasonable prices. The new smoked meat menu is awesome. The all day breakfast is a must.', 'We all enjoyed our breakfast here. The portions were large and the price reasonable. Cash or debit only. \nNot the prettiest of places outside or inside, but food is worth it.', ""So, let me start with the good points.  First, the three people we dealt with in there were all very friendly, and seemed genuinely liked they wanted to deliver a good experience.  Second, the food was generally solid.\n\nLet's get on to the reasons for...the poor review.  From a practical perspective, the service was exceedingly slow.  We were a party of four, and not in any great hurry, but with only two other small tables occupied, and already eating when we arrived, it eventually became baffling as to why we were waiting so long for any food, especially since our orders were three omelettes and one plate of pancakes.  The coffee took a long time to come, and because our initial server suddenly disappeared, never to be seen again during our visit, there was probably a disconnect.\n\nBut here are a couple of things that you need to know.  First, while we were waiting for food, our soon-to-be server was putting napkins with utencils on the tables, and she dropped one set on the floor.  My wife was surprised to see her bend over, pick them up, and put them on the table.  And it is not as if that floor is sparkling clean.  But here is the real kicker:  my daughter complained that her pancakes, which came to the table looking big, fluffy and delicious, tasted like onion.  I dismissed it as her imagination, but she insisted that she had actually found a piece of onion in it.  So, my wife took the plate, and while she was doing a sampling actually found a piece of onion herself.  When the cook came out of the kitchen, which was in a small sectioned off area right behind us, I called him over and politely explained our observation.  He didn't deny it, and in fact explained to me that the reason was that they only have one pan.  So, because the pancakes were made after my wife's omelette, which did legitimately contain onions, that is what caused it.  I could scarcely believe this.  And, as the family's lone vegetarian, I wondered what would have happened if the bacon were made before my omelette?!  \n\nTo be fair, he offered to make us a new plate of pancakes.  When we declined, he did the right thing and removed it from the bill.  So, as I say, he was nice, and the omelettes were good.  But I feel compelled to warn people that, of the numerous all-day breakfast options available, they may want to skip this one.  Unfortunately, we won't be back again.More"", 'We live in the area and finally went.  Very glad we did.  The food was very good and the portions unbelievable. We ordered a big breakfast, regular size breakfasts and a Nutella crepe.  We had way too much food as the portions were incredibly large....Guess we were use to all the smaller sizes from other breakfast places.  As we were sitting and having our breakfast, it be came apparent that we were only the new people in the restaurant. Everyone was greeted with a �Nice to see you again.�  �Same breakfast as before?�  Signs of a loyal crowd and staff that know their regulars. \n\nWill definitely return.  \n\nWarning - The outside is not fancy and there is not a lot of room inside.More', 'I would give this place 5 stars but it really needs a good cleaning and paint job. I kinda got the heeby jeebies when I got in there but I soon forgot about them when the food came. \n\nThe food was fresh, the portion size...was extremely generous, very hot, and yummy.  I had an omelette for breakfast and didn�t have to eat until dinner.  It was full of ham and cheese, and the potatoes were really good too. YumMore', ""Best breakfast ever!!!  Don't let the front of the restaurant deter you.  Inside is clean and the staff are the friendliest.  Was attending a wedding down the road at the Hilton and I refuse to pay $20.00 for an egg and coffee.  Looked up this...restaurant just down the road and was so happy I did.

Not sure if the service was so slow because it was Mother\'s Day, but we waited over an hour to get our food. Luckily our family didn\'t mind sitting there chit-chatting while we...waited.\n\nCute little diner style restaurant. Holds no more than 40-50 people max. There is only one chef, one waitress and I believe someone doing dishes in the back. This could explain the wait times.\n\nHowever, even with the wait, when the food arrived, it was all cooked to perfection. Portions were SO big that you almost can\'t complain about the wait for it. Everything was delicious. We ordered items as simple as french toast, up to items like a Crabcake Benedict, which was one of the specials that day.\n\nWill definitely go back on a ""non-holiday"" to evaluate if the service improves.More']"

Then as soon as the food arrives,  they literally shoves the bill to my sister. There were 2 free seats at the table and they had to squeeze it btwn my sister and my niece.

When I tried to look for a server to give me my cheque around 10:40 pm, I noticed that there were several servers gathered around the cashier so...I waved at them to come over. Apparently they were all 'busy' chit chatting among themselves that no none seemed to see me waving at them. Finally I saw a male server on his way coming towards my table carrying some food in this hand so I waved at him. Although he saw me waving at him, he didn't nod or acknowledge, nothing, so I kept on waving at him. Finally he opened his mouth and said he did see me and he'll come to me when he's free. I think it's common courtesy as a server that if a customer asks for your help and you are not available right away, at least you should acknowledge or you should ask some other co-workers who are available nearby to come to see what I want (as mentioned above there were several of them at the cashier talking to each other). One thing that really upsets me when dining out in a restaurant is to see servers happily chit chatting to each other instead of looking around to see if there are customers who need their service. If they like to talk so much among themselves they should do so after work or the restaurant can arrange regular business meetings when they can talk among themselves as much as they want. Fortunately I don't to go Congee Queen (Markham) very often, I always go to the Don Mills/Steeles and Leslie/Highway 7 branches and the servers there are always very attentive and polite to customers.

Tables was not cleaned to my expectation!!. Had to order from a photocopy of a menu (due to Covid there is no buffet table), which I understand. We ordered a Lamb dish ($19) and a Chicken Biryani...($17) dish. I was shocked when the food arrived. The Lamb curry dish was SO small (Probably worth $2-3 to prepare), came with nothing else (Rice would have been nice) and the Biryani was enough for two people. Food did taste nice but I felt it was overpriced for the amount we got. When I mentioned the expensive cost to the Waiter, his reply was the the Rent for the place was expensive and someone has to pay higher prices to cover the rent, Really???? What a rude waiter. I told him, I was not there to pay the rent of the place. Nevertheless, I will never patronized this place again.More', 'Worst restaurant ever. Stupid policies. Ruined the experience. Never ever go there. Bad bad bad never recommended.', 'My family recently went to this restaurant and figured I should write a review as we were blown away at this place! So, let\'s break it down...\n\n1. Location - it\'s easy to get to. close to the highway exits, and plenty of parking. Having...2 small kids - we didn\'t find it an issue. Mind you - it was Sunday at noon - so that may have factored into it. Unsure of how that area is on weekdays/weeknights/weekend nights.\n\n2. Food - when you\'re asked ""where should i go and have Indian food"" - the Host is generally a top answer. I\'ve frequented the downtown location was ok with their food - however, trying this location out - and I\'m quite wowed by it. They serve your main Indian food - curries, tandoori, naans, rice, etc. However, they go the extra mile with a chaat/bhel station - where the guy is making it FRESH for you! They also have a freshly made gilibi (indian sweet) station - FRESH!! The turnover of food is really great here as lots of people eating and the food was definitely FRESH! Just one thing - I felt the tandoori chicken was a bit too \'saucy\' vs. dry. This is my personal preference though .. the chicken was still really great!! Take note to others - take the tandoori chicken and then put some of the butter chicken sauce on top - it\'s a win win!\n\n3. Drinks - my wife had a lassi and I was able to try it. It\'s really good their mango lassi... I on the other hand ordered a coke - to future visitors - don\'t order carbonated drinks at a buffet if you want to maximize your value! LOL\n\n4. Desserts - usual suspects. However, what blew us away was the fresh gilibi station. A must! \n\n5. Kid Friendly - as I mentioned - two young kids.... and they loved it! They don\'t like spicy food - and we actually didn\'t find the food spicy (ok, maybe a dish or two but generally not too spicy like other places we\'ve frequented). We had our table in the back room - so, there was plenty of space for our group. The servers were really nice with our kids too - much appreciated.\n\n6. Service - no complaints there. They came seeing if we wanted anything, and cleared our plates regularly. Really genuine and nice people and service.\n\n7. Bathrooms - Clean! My little boy had to frequent it a few times - and everything was fine for him. I wasn\'t disgusted like other Indian restaurants I have gone to before.\n\n8. Price - reasonable. We went on a Sunday - i think it was like $21/adult - but worth it considering the many choices, and freshness of the food. \n\nSo - reflecting back and reading my review - definitely positive. I usually like to give some \'criticism\' or suggested areas of improvement - and unfortunately, I don\'t have any - we had a great experience. Thank you The Host! Will be back again someday (unfortunately - it is a bit further from our hose to frequent regularly)!More', 'My family went for buffet lunch. There were lots of options.

But for it to take over 1.5 hours for lunch when we had no cocktails/drinks and no appetizers and ordered the first time she got to our table (which probably took 10+ minutes) is ridiculous. I�m disappointed. The service was really really lacking. I could tell other tables were getting anxious and frustrated too as they sat with dirty plates in front of them and couldn�t flag the waitress either.

The lobster in the shell was put on top of the spaghetti. Which should be separate because the sauce got all over the lobster making it messy. She brought the lobster cuter but didn�t bring the tiny fork. Things were lacking with the service. The server had to be reminded of the cake for the Birthday. But she was friendly and apologetic.

I went there, not expecting to encounter the first racist experience I've had since I became an immigrant in Canada....My boyfriend and I arrived at the restaurant around 6:00 pm, and there was another white couple who went in the same time as we did.  The restaurant was indeed full at first glance, with almost no empty seats inside (but also a few empty seats, perhaps for reservation, which is understandable) The waitress was greeting customers inside the bar at the entrance. She was firstly very nice to the other couple, with a big smile on her face and gently told them that they are full right now and asked them if they would like to wait for 10-20 minutes. They accepted her proposal and wait aside.\n \nThen I and my boyfriend stepped up and asked the waitress if we could also wait for a table, since our friend highly recommended their place, we don�t mind waiting.\n \nHowever,  I didn't expect that suddenly she lost her nice attitude and glanced up and down at my boyfriend and I. Then she yelled at us: 'I just said, no table for today'. Thinking that she might not understand my words---- I wasn't trying to force my way in but I was willing to wait for a table (and there was no one at the patio as well), I explained again and asked how long it would take to wait for a table, Then, I heard her words saying 'not today, it's not going to happen, you must have reservation. She refused to accommodate us, not even trying. We were so embarrassed that we were asked to leave. And we left with shame as if we have done something wrong. We even forgot to get angry and never confronted her. But as we think through the situation over and over. We get more confused about why the waitress refused her service.\n \nI even thought of if there's anything, our words, behaviors or even our dress would offend her. I thought I had asked her politely from the beginning to the end, plus, it is not a 'fancy' restaurant, everyone dressed casually so there's no way that we get refused by dress code. After excluding all possible factor, must admit that there wasn�t nothing but just our race that had made her treat us differently \n \nThe more I thought about it when I got home, the angrier I got, so I left a message on google maps. I saw that the store manager had responded to almost all the reviews with nice attitude to solve their problems, and he responded fast. so, I thought I'd see if I can get any of their explanation from them by writing down my true review. It's been nearly 5 days; I did not receive any response or apology.

The level of consistency we have experienced here is unlike any other restaurant. The dumplings are perfect every time. The wood ear mushroom salad is a must. Wontons in spicy sauce are fantastic. This is now a must...on every trip!!More', 'Was here 20 years ago visiting Toronto.  Food quality is still excellent and consistent.  Have not had the authentic Shanghai hot and sour soup for years since there is no restaurant in Calgary can make any.  Probably pricey compare with other Shanghai restaurant, but the...food quality worth the price.  This Ding Tai Fung offers more food selection than the ones in Taipei (mainly for tourists, not for locals due to high pricing).More', 'Took my family for the first time for Dim Sum. Great selection, almost too much to choose from. Dishes are large so be careful. We ended up packing half of it. Bit tough to find with so many little restaurants in the same strip. Great...spot!More', 'I am well aware that this restaurant is not associated with the Taiwanese based chain sharing a similar name. \nHowever, they aspire to serve the same type of broth filled dumplings.\nThere is no comparison between the two. \nThere is a very limited selection of...dim sum served here. Almost all are pork based. No shrimp or beef dumplings. At least the dumplings were edible but not great.The Shanghai Noodles were very bland. The stewed beef pancake wrap tasted odd and was not edible.\nThe dished were quite expensive considering the size and the quality.More', ""I've been to this jewel of Markham more than once and I keep coming back. One virtue that Ding Tai Fung has that keeps it on my favourites list is the consistency. Every time I visit I have the same great experience, right from the...caring and attentive staff, who greet you warmly as you arrive, to the servers who take their time to explain the food and recommend items, to the food itself which is always fresh, and great tasting. This is a classic dim sum joint that pays homage to the Shanghai Style of cooking. On this visit for the review, we came on a busy day, waited only ten minutes as we did have a reservation but also know that this is a busy place. I do recommend a reservation as I've had people tell me they have waited a long time in line. \n\n     This was a group visit so we ordered a plethora of dishes some common and some new. The servers brought the food out slowly, which was great as we had little room on the table to put many of the dishes. It also gave us a pause between dishes so we could actually enjoy it hot and right from the kitchen. I have been to so many Dim Sum places that just simply pile the dishes on the table and then take off and leave you in an uncomfortable situation and afraid you'll spill something. All the dishes that came out were of high quality and a good standard of presentation and flavour. I really enjoyed the soup-filled dumplings, the stir-fried lamb and the shrimp fried rice. I typically enjoy most of the dishes at this restaurant. I highly recommend this place and I will be back.More"", 'Do not hesitate! This place is excellent. The best soup filled dumplings I have ever had. Also - ask for the snow pea leaf, it�s so good! Everything we ordered was delicious and we had great service.', 'Being a person who would travel miles to taste the genuine cuisine, many years ago we did travel to the origin city of soupy Xiao Long Bao (the city of Nan Xiang, just outside Shanghai) and had tasted the real ones, and then tasting again...of the soupy Xiao Long Bao and other dishes, many more times in the old city of Shanghai. \n\nWe would like to say they are very genuine here in Markham. I saw some reviews below that it was fake here and would like to comment that the dishes were very genuine to the real Shanghai taste, to be fair to the wonderful chefs here.\n\nThe restaurant, although not particularly spacious, especially for couples, would be comfortable enough for a small group of 4-8. The couple tables are quite tightly close to each other but still by the window so if you come here for the real Shanghai taste and atmosphere (but not quiet romance), it should fulfil both your stomach and your mind well. \n\nFor the two of us we ordered one basket of the soupy Xiao Long Bao, the fried dumplings, some buns and a dish of vegetables and it was around $50 tax incl. so it was ok consider the food was really yummy.\n\nNext time I would come with a group so we could order many other dishes too, which we saw other customers happily enjoying!\n\nTips to eat soupy Xiao Long Bao without ruining it: use your chopsticks to lightly hold the top of the bun (the knot) to secure it. Then gently remove it from the steamer.\nTo tell whether the chef is good or not: if you do it gently, the bottom of the bun will not be stuck to the steamer and break, thus releasing all the soup inside. Advice from a gourmet lover who did line up many times to get in the best bun restaurant in old Shanghai!More', ""Don't let the non-descript strip mall location fool you - Ding Tai Fung serves up excellent  dim sum with great service.  You come here for the dumplings and they are excellent - be sure to order the Sticky Rice and Meat and Steamed Chive and...Meat options.  The wait staff are very knowledgable and will guide you through the menu if you're not sure what to order.  Prices are very reasonable and the dishes served quickly.More"", ""It's been a long time since I last came here for lunch. The beef noodle soup was good.  Beef was well made, no fats. The dumping is OK too."", 'We loved the soupy dumplings here although they are a bit pricey! I recently went to the San Francisco branch of the  famous Din Tai Fung chain of restaurants & thought this was part of that franchise but it is not ... and the soupy...dumplings here are much tastier!More', ""This is a little off the beaten path and very hard to park anywhere close.  It frankly is not my favourite style of food but everybody else raves.  \nThere is no rhyme or reason how the food comes out and I don't know what to...recommend.  \nThe kitchen is immaculate!More""]"

I had put off dining at Inspire for no real good reason. Finally went, and could kick myself for not going sooner. Especially as that meant I would now be a repeat customer. Will right that wrong!...Five us went on a Friday evening. The cocktails are wonderful. Apps of tacos and calamari, wonderful. Recommend both. Did I mention that the plates used for your cutlery are are there for a purpose? Makes sharing of apps and even sampling or sharing mains very easy!  Great idea!\nMains of burger, chicken burger, and udon were wonderful. Great flavours!\nService was wonderful. Great value. Will be returning soon! \nThe restaurant is well laid out, comfortable and busy.\nMake reservations to be safe.\nHighly recommended.More', ""On this night we got the FoodCrew together to head into Inspire Restaurant In Markham Village!! It was most of the group's first time there and luckily we made reservations way before we went as this is a local hotspot that is super busy on...weekends. The place has very trendy and inspiring decor, with a great colour scheme that really matches the food. Our servers were awesome as many come to our table during our visit. The kids ordered first and got handmade beef patties on fresh buns with a mountain of hand-cut fries ( I had to help them eat some ). I started with their popular and beautiful take on tacos, the Duck Tacos made with Duck Confit, Jicama Orange Salsa, Duck Egg Curried Mayo, Feta and served on Flour Tortillas!! Man O Man were those good!! Next up were the mains, we ordered the Simply Short Ribs with two Potatoes a very well made and presented take on short ribs made with Blue Cheese, a Shiitake Demi glaze, Spinach Truffle Mash covered in Potato Strings and served with Sweet Corn. Talk about tender, those short ribs were amazing !! For my main course, I had the Famous Shitaki Udon Carbonara made with Spicy Italian Sausage, Braised Beef, Creamy Shiitake sauce, Seasonal Mushrooms, with Parm and topped with Quail Egg!! Now hear this folks!!!  It�s bigger than it looks and a real filler, I had to take some of this home after.. oh yeah, did I mention how good it was?? If you are looking for great, creative cookin� and looking to be inspired, Inspire is the place to go!!More"", ""Excellent food and attentive service, but the restaurant is too cold because the front door isn't properly isolated from the cold blast of winter.......makes for an uncomfortable delicious evening out !\nNot cheap, so I'm sure I'm not the first to be unhappy about this....Love the consistent kitchen, so am a regular.More"", ""We made a reservation for 8 for my birthday at end of September 2019.  Since it's a small, popular establishment they asked me to make sure I had right number of reserved spots that evening.  Family and I found it quickly and parking was right...near by.  Small interior, but very interesting decor but it was highly recommended for the food that the kitchens produced.  We were not disappointed.  The menu had many variables and by our table talk, all was inspirational.  Hence the name, I guess.  Before long, the place was crowded with people and music and talk mixed with laughter of guests.  The bill was in the high end but well worth the raves I heard and the promises to come back here again from my table.More"", 'Easy to book the restaurant. Nice space. I was unfortunate to be dining along side screeching kids, so if it�s quiet dining you want, come later. The chicken burger was excellent, no complaints at all. The panna cotta...I should have skipped. Needs work or just...deleting.More', 'Very impressed with a first visit to Inspire. Thoughtful details distinguished each dish we sampled - variety of flavours, textures, cooking styles. Everything was enjoyable, satisfying and often surprising. \n\nStarted with a California Nachos with taro chips, ahi, avocado, pickled onion, jalape�os and spicy mayo,...which was excellent. \n\nHanoi Greens salad was enlivened by pomegranate, radish, beats and more chilies.\n\nOur three entrees were all delicious. A playful Udon Carbonara with spicy sausage instead of bacon, and served with a raw quail egg.  \n\nThai meatballs with coconut, which were succulent and pricked with spicy heat. \n\nThe Moco Loco, with both a dutiful observance of traditional Hawaiian composition - a housemade medium rare burger served on rice, but it was taken a notch higher with Shiitake Demi glaze, crispy onion strings and saut�ed shrimp. (Unfortunately, the must have fried egg atop the gorgeous plate, was quite over cooked which took away from the unctuous blend of gravy and runny yolk...)\n\nService was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.\n\nDefinitely planning a return visit. Lots of similarly adventurous items we were tempted to try!More', 'Creative menu, unique ingredients, layered flavours... delicious every single time and I am determined to work through the menu. Intimate environment on Main Street and excellent, personable service. The owners clearly take great pride in their business. Can\'t wait to check out their new location...in Newmarket! I encourage you to support this small business in this ""big box"" generation.More', 'Inspire is an awesome restaurant and always at the top of my list when picking a place to dine out in Markham. This is a tiny restaurant with fabulous food and friendly service. I�ve tried many of the dishes on the menu and have never...been disappointed. If you enjoy Asian fusion and amazing food, this is an awesome place. Make a reservation as it�s busy every night.More', 'My partner and I decided on a whim to travel to Markham for the Pacific Mall and figured we would stop to eat somewhere along the way. I looked for good places to get brunch/lunch for vegetarians and vegans, and Inspire was the first place...to pop up, so we went there. The restaurant was completely full at the time and asked that we come back in half an hour to 45 minutes, which is understandable, we should have made a reservation, but were not aware of how popular this place was at the time. After 45 minutes, my partner and I were able to get a table and we were slightly disappointed with the lack of vegetarian options on the menu, as it appeared that a salad was our best bet for this place after having high hopes for some vegetarian dishes with the popular reviews via Google. I ordered the Hanoi Greens Salad and he ordered the Napa Cobb Salad without bacon, as those were the only apparent vegetarian options on the menu, sadly. After waiting about 30 minutes, we got our salads and they were enormous and surprisingly much more delicious than I was expecting. \n\nI loved the Hanoi Greens Salad, but I hope the restaurant explores more vegetarian dishes, as I would love to be able to order at least a small variety of different things each time I go.More', 'The place is really small. Very casual. Food was interesting, my partner had a hard time picking something to eat. I tried the greens salad, it was dry and not very flavorful, ceviche, which was ok, and a vegetarian burger. The food is just ok,...but I thought that fried chicken on a waffle was a bit of a stretch.More', 'Went with my wife last Thursday and we both had a wonderful meal. I had a Loco Moco and my wife ordered a Chicken & Waffles. Taste was really good. Price were fair and resonable. Will definitely visit again. Dinning area is relatively small so...be sure to make a reservation in advance.More', 'I took my 13 year old daughter one friday on a date. She had wanted to try something different than the usual Markham Asian or chain restaurant and Inspire did not disappoint. We both started off with appetizers, but the clear winner was the ""Extra...Butter"" Drunken Crustaceans. I think we should\'ve ordered 2!\n\nFor the entree, i had the Insp Loco Moco which was very good. I\'ve enjoyed Loco Moco before in my trips to Maui, but the coconut gravy with the shrimp definitely enhanced it. My daughter had the Waff Out Loud because she had wanted some steak. I had thought it would have a little chicken and a little steak but it had large portions of each! it was very good as well, but far too much for her to eat - even more than i would eat! This may sound weird, but i might suggest reducing the portion size.\n\nBe warned that the restaurant is small, so reservations are recommended. While the menu choices are limited, they are very good. This little local gem is certainly worth a visit and i will likely be back with one of my other kids or my wife.More', 'I went there last night, shared the beef salad for starter and it was amazing. Although 20 for a salad seemed expensive, it can feed two. Salad is my favorite part of the meal. I ordered the Inspire loco moco, and it was not bad....It is beef patties covered with mushroom sauce. It was a little too rich for my taste. My husband had the curry meatball, he liked it but again was too rich. I definitely return to try the other stuff on the menu. \nPlace filled up quick so need reservation. Service was great.More', 'Very unique combinations but everything was delicious. I went with some friends and we all enjoyed our meal! I would definately recommend the pulled pork fried and Loco Moco.', 'Went for lunch with my husband and we both really enjoyed it. He had the chicken and waffles and I had the inspire burger. My husband really enjoyed his meal and I loved the burger. We tried the duck fries also and they were good...too.I  definitely recommend this place.More']"
