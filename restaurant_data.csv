New Orleans Seafood & Steakhouse,4.5 of 5 bubbles,"267 Scarlett Rd York, Toronto, Ontario M6N 4L1 Canada","We've been eating at New Orleans for over a decade and our experience has always been fabulous. The atmosphere is warm and cozy, and food is always top notch (we're big fans of the jambalaya :) Service is fantastic...Mike and his team are always eager...to accommodate. Reservations are a must for weekends as the place is always packed. (It's often busy during the week as well so best to call ahead to reserve a table!)More
Incompetent customer service. Why bother making reservations when they font honour them? But glad we left cause the place smelled of mold , old outdated staff unfriendly. Carpet all over in a restaurant that serves seafood ? Imagine the smell very unpleasant. I’m all for...supporting local restaurants which is why we had decided to try this place . But unfortunately they don’t know how to provide a pleasant experience for patrons .More
Great table service.  Attentive, Knowledgeable, Personable, Interested and fast.  The owner mingled with all his guests adding a charming welcome to the experience.  The restaurant is also very intimate.  

The Caesars are fabulous.

The food was hot, delicious, and of excellent quality.  It just didn't...seem ""cajuny"" enough for us.  The choices made for some of the ingredients of the Gumbo seemed out of place, missing.  Making  it difficult to fully experience the ""cajun"".  But it was delicious.

And I still recommend the New Orleans Seafood and Stakehouse.More
We had dinner here largely because of TripAdvisor ratings. We weren't disappointed.  Mike, the owner, is very gracious and attentive.  We shared the coconut shrimp appetizer and then had creole shrimp and the strip steak. Everything was well prepared,  service impeccable and a quiet and...refined atmosphere.  We very much enjoyed dinner and would go back.More
Very good cajun seafood. Delicious 
coconut beer shrimps, crab cakes and shrimp creole. Family attended. Will visit again.
This is one of my favorite restaurants. The food is incredible and the service is beyond reproach. Mike is the consummate host. also a smile and a handshake!
We travel an hour to and hour and a half to go there and it's worth it.
We had a dinner party for 8 to celebrate my 65th birthday. It was perfect in every way, service, food, drinks, and atmosphere! It was very busy on a Saturday night, and they deserve to be busy! They do an amazing job. The only thing...missing was Marilyn Monroe singing ""Happy Birthday Mr. President""! LOL!
Thanks, Mike, for another great time at your fantastic restaurant!
P.S. Their steaks are the very best you will ever find in Toronto!!!More
The food at this location very fresh. The service is top-notch. It’s a little hole in the wall kind of place you would never expect the food to be this good, but it is. The owner will come out and greet you. And they always...end the meal with a nice complementary drink.  Which was a nice surprise.More
The food was amazing! Their seafood items such as the coconut shrimp, crab cakes, and jambalayas were full of flavour. I didn't get a chance to try yhe steak skewers, but everyone I talked to that did try it said it was perfectly done.

I'll...definitely be back with friends to try out other items on their menu. Thank you!More
Love visiting here. Every time we go, we’re treated like family. The service is top notch and the owners are just incredible. I’m not even going to mention the food. Always consistent, always amazingly delicious. 10/10 would always recommend.
For anyone who remembers Sammy's Seafood Creole on Lakeshore Blvd when it was known for amazing ambiance and distinguished food you need to go here. It's ten times better, and Mike the manager and host is extremely friendly and knows how to make people feel...at home. My family and I have gone here on a few occasions and we continue to do so even though it's out of our way. Beer battered coconut shrimp, jambalaya, crab cakes are my favourites on the signature menu. Last time I was there I chose the steak of the day and the demiglace and vegetable accompliments were cooked to perfection. For anyone who wants the best of the best in Toronto this is not only a hidden gem, but a place to indulge and enjoy because of the incredible food and beyond exceptional guest service. I work at a 5 star Marriott hotel in Toronto
 I send guests here on a regular basis, and always receive praise for the reference. Thank you New Orleans for never letting my reference fail.More
Went for dinner with colleagues, had reservations which are highly recommended. Smallish, cozy, lovely atmosphere just like in Louisiana. Great service, the owner came by a few time to ensure things were to our satisfaction. Fantastic meal, fresh, unbelievably flavourful, good selection and choices. Wine...menu was very good. Overall a fantastic meal, charming place, flavours to die for and impeccable service. Highly recommended.More
We have been looking for a restaurant in the GTA that serves New Orleans style of food. We found a little gem that everyone should try and you won't regret it. The restaurant is a family run business and Mike and his family are charming...hosts, delightful! Starters included a tasty Caesar Salad, with crispy fresh romaine and freshly shaved Parmigiano Reggiano that was well balanced. The Cajun Calamari were made to perfection and very tender. The Coconut Beer Shrimp was nicely balanced and not too sweet. The Seafood Gumbo was a bit on the thin side but had good flavour. The mains were terrific, three of us had the delicious, melt in your mouth Chilean Sea Bass which was reasonably priced to boot! Our youngest likes steak and he had the blackened strip loin with green peppercorn sauce. The steak was tender and better than the steak he had at Hy's downtown earlier this year. To end the evening we had Beignet's, Bananas Foster, Pecan Pie and Crème Caramel. Mike provided complimentary after dinner aperitifs which was a surprise and a nice touch. We will be back!More
Had dinner last night at New Orleans Seafood and Steakhouse.  The atmosphere, food, drinks and service were all outstanding.  We had a larger party (7 people), but all meals were served hot and fresh.  We will definitely be going back.  And the after dinner drink...was the cherry on top.  Thank you so much for making my special day so much more special.More
The service is impeccable, and the food is the closest to the ones I have tried at New Orleans. We are not from Toronto, but wouldn’t mind the long drive to go back to this place. Mike (the owner, I believe), provided service like no...one from the nice and fancy restaurants we’ve been to has ever had. We will definitely go back whenever we have the chance to.More"
