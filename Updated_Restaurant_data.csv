The Keg Steakhouse + Bar - Esplanade,4.5,"26 The Esplanade Esplanade, Toronto, Ontario M5E 1A7 Canada","['American', 'Steakhouse', 'Canadian']",899,"[""This restaurant was recommended by a friend who had recently visited Toronto. We're from Chicago and have many fine steakhouses and I would put The Keg near the top of the list! My husband began with an order of the calamari, which he had no...trouble finishing. He had a maitai to start and I had a glass of sauvignon blanc. For my entree I had the petit (7oz) filet mignon with garlic mash potatoes and vegetables. It was absolutely delicious! My husband had the 14 oz prime rib with garlic mash potatoes and vegetables and he virtually inhaled it! We received a complimentary slice of Billy Miner chocolate pie, which we probably could have done without, but had to taste it! Sam, our server, was wonderful. Halfway through our meal a family group of 6 adults and a small child (6 months old?) came in and were seated nearby. The adults were obnoxious in their attempts to keep the child amused and while we didn't rush through the rest of our meal, we were glad to get away from them because they ruined the mood of relaxation and enjoyment for everyone in our section. Prices were reasonable for the quality of the food and service.More"", 'Perfectly cooked filletÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½.melted in the mouth.\nAlways enjoy our visitsÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½.thanks for another lovely meal.', 'The KEG steakhouse at the Esplanande is a must for us, when visiting Toronto. Constantly good steaks at high level and very nice service.', 'Service was great and attentive.  They offered Specials that were all lobster based, and allowed to substitute a ribeye instead of a top sirloin for one of the specials.  Chicago style ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½charÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ was perfectly prepared.', 'We went to the Keg before and loved it but didnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t have a great experience this timeÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ \n\nMy friends order The ribs and they were fine and the ribeye steak was ok. However, I ordered a steak medium rare and it came out blue and...mushy. Would recommend to ensure the servers hear what you or saying or you could be handed anything. \n\nThe cake was amazing, defo recommend. Wine was 10 out of 10.More', 'We enjoyed delicious prime rib and a nice base ball steak. Service is very friendly and swift. The atmosphere in the restaurant is nice and intimate. \n\nWe enjoyed!', 'Had a fantastic family dinner here tonight, three generations all had a brilliant meal which is hard to normally do but The Keg succeeded.\nAndy was our server and he was knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. \nA variety of dishes my mother in law and sister...in law both tried two different Vegan/vegetarian dishes (neither are vegan/vegetarian ) and said it was really tasty, that was the vegan shepherds pie and the vegetarian meatloaf. \nThe steaks were cooked to perfection absolutely delicious, my daughter who I gave her bits of my steak as she had the kids keg burger loved it and she is a really really picky eater. \nI would come back here again really tasty, great food.More', 'We were walk-ins, but made to feel really welcome. Shown to one table that was fine, but spotted one we preferred and - without fuss or faff - they swapped us over. \n\nSteaks were cooked perfectly to how we ordered them and the service was...excellent. \n\nWe had no room for dessert but as we were about to ask for the bill, they appeared with a (huge) complimentary slice of Billy [something] pie: coffee ice cream, flaked almonds, drizzled with caramel on a crunchy chocolate biscuit baseÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ All my favourite things in one. Delicious! \n\nSo we left very full, very happy and having had wonderful service from start to finish.More', 'A bit too expensive for me but it is ok if go there once a while. They are the best for many years.', ""Hi again,\n\nWe're doing a lot of restaurant dining lately! I could get used to this!\n\nLast night we chose to dine at the Keg Steakhouse and Bar on the Esplanade in downtown Toronto. \n\nFor all my Canadian friends reading this, we all know that...there are Kegs everywhere! For my American friends reading this, if you come to Canada for a visit,  please don't leave without trying this lovely chain restaurant. If you're a steak fan, this is the place for you. \n\nThe Keg has been around for years, and they never disappoint. We've been to a few locations around the country and never had a disappointing meal there (truth).\n\nOkay, so about our evening.  \n\nARRIVING THERE:\nWe got there around 8 p.m. or so, and being a Saturday night, figured we'd have to wait a long time for a table. Nope. We were seated inside within a couple of minutes. We had the choice of the patio or inside, and we chose inside.\n\nLOCATION:\nThis particular property is located on the Esplanade in downtown Toronto, just east off Yonge St. and within walking distance to just about everything including Union Station, the Eaton Centre, Front Street, the Distillery District, the King Edward Hotel and the Harbourfront. It's a great location. There is public parking nearby as well. \n\nDECOR:\nThe Keg's decor is quite lovely ... low lighting, comfortable chairs and tables (or booths), fireplaces and an overall lovely vibe ... very relaxed yet at the same time you can see people are enjoying themselves. It's a nice environment.\n\nDRESS CODE:\nI'm not sure there is one - we saw people in jean shorts as well as some who were dressed up. I think the bottom line here is, don't look like slob and don't wear flip flops and you'll be okay. If you're not sure, give them a call and just ask. \n\nBAR:\nYes, there is a bar at the front of the restaurant and you can just go there for drinks and bar food if you like.\n\nMENU & FOOD QUALITY:\nThe menu is lovely - we always order the teriyaki classic, but there's lots to choose from - salmon, chicken, different kinds of steaks, a burger.  You won't leave your table hungry. \n\nThe wine list is extensive enough that it'll please everyone. They even have Canadian wines on their roster which, to me, is important. Canada has a great wine industry and it's nice to see our restaurants actively supporting them. \n\nThe Billy Miner pie is a classic Keg dessert and a must-have. \n\nThe Keg also gives you complimentary sourdough bread with butter with your dinner (they actually serve it a bit before while you're perusing the wine list!)  \n\nSERVICE:\nService is ALWAYS friendly and prompt, but they don't hover over you annoyingly.  If you tell them it's your birthday, they'll likely sing to you.  :) \n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nWith hundreds of locations around Canada, you won't have any trouble finding a Keg Steakhouse near you. Highly recommend this terrific restaurant chain. \n\nHappy dining.  :)More"", 'We visited The Keg on the Esplanade with family and a friend who was visiting from Australia. Our server, Jonah was a total professional who treated us so well and made great recommendations.  All five of us had different entrÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½es which were thoroughly enjoyed. This...wasnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t our first visit and it will definitely not be our last.More', 'Went here for my birthday and the ambience food and wine and service was faultless, received a birthday card and cake and had a thoroughly wonderful experience would definitely return', 'Atmosphere is cozy with the dimmed lights and fireplaces. Great place for couples. Our food was great. We had the peppercorn steak with veggiesÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½. Which the veggies were a wide variety.  Amazing amount of veggies . Had the burger and it was juicy. Caesar salad...and mixed green salad were large and very good. Loved the vinaigrette on the garden salad.  It was very busy there so our table did feel wedged in between others.  Our server was friendly and constantly he king on us. However, their was a young man who ever time walked past us69 wipe down tables, left an unpleasant odour. IÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½m surprised his coworkers have not complained about this.  It was really strong and very offensive. But without that, it was a perfect dinner out. Will return to this locationMore', 'We were sat at a table but for some reason, I donÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t think a server was assigned to us.  We were in no rush but when another party were seated at the table next to us some 10 minutes later and were immediately offered drinks,...we did wonder.  We were then spotted by a passing host who came over and asked if everything was OK.  We said that we were still waiting so she took a drinks order and arranged for water to be brought to the table. We were then visited by a manager offering his sincere apologies for the delay and when we said we had not yet ordered food, he immediately brought a server to our table. From that point. The service was impeccable and the meal itself was great. The baked shrimp appetiser was delicious as was the filet mignon served with a twice baked potato.  We were then brought a complementary dessert which was also very nice although we were quite full so unable to finish it.  When the bill came, as another gesture of goodwill and by way of compensating for the initial delay in service, the cost of our wine was deducted.  Overall it was a great experience and we were surprised and genuinely appreciated the compensation given.More', 'This restaurant was booked by our travel operator so we didnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t know when to expect when bringing 10 teenagers on a school visit. \nRomana was wonderful, she engaged well with our students and made them feel relaxed and welcome. \nDoor staff (sorry I didnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t get...his name) joked on with our students as we left, fist pumped and chatted with them about their visit from the UK. \nFood was also incredible.More']", Toronto

The beef tartare was excellent, but everything else was nothing special.

They start you off with a gluten free cheese bite topped with a pickled jalapeno that is just delightful.   I ordered the lamb vindaloo dumplings.  The dumplings are stuffed with shredded lamb, fried, then topped with chutney, mint and...I think a yogurt sauce then plated with vindaloo sauce.   I was kind of hoping for a soup style dumpling where the vindaloo sauce was inside the dumpling with the lamb and that it was steamed but regardless it was quite tasty.  It wasn't spicy so don't be scared of the word vindaloo. I wish I could have tried more.More"", 'Cozy and friendly restaurant, the idea is to share different dishes from the menu.

We ordered 12 (2 per person) and it really was not quite enough food.\n\nThe Rasa Burger was the best of the lot but overpriced ($21) considering the small size. No fries or sides to go with it. The chopped salad was not bad but way overpriced ($20) considering the size and very simple ingredients (greens and chickpeas). The Spicy Cerviche was ok but nothing memorable. The lamb tacos (($21) were barely edible. The desserts were awful ($16 each). The sticky bun is a supermarket type cinnamon bun sickly sweet and not edible, but still better than the sweet dish which was a mess of chocolate cake and rice that was awful to look at and even more awful to eat.\n\nThe service was good but extremely slow.\n\nAll in all a very expensive meal that left us completely unsatisfied and still hungry when left.\n\nWe have been to this restaurant a number of times in the past. I doubt that we will visit again.More', 'We were 2 couples and we started off with their Refreshing Peach drink, and a Spicy concoction.

Service was amazing and the food was really tasty.\n\nThe only issue was the portion size. They say it is Tapas style, but for $25 of Squash Ravioli, there could definitely be more on the plate, or like have more than 1 tentacle for $42 of Octopus.\n\nWe finished our meal with their Sweet Dish.

IÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ll say these set the bar high as they were off the charts flavorful.  Next came the tuna tataki and the Brussel sprouts.  The tuna was light and refreshing.  We were a little disappointed with the Brussel sprouts.  I personally love Brussel sprouts but these were just okay.  Then they brought the truffle knudi which was incredible but by that time we were getting full.  Not wanting to miss our chance at dessert we ordered the plum pavlova.

I think my date was intimidated into ordering it, and at first they didn\'t want to serve it to my date unless we each ordered it, which was ridiculous and the kind of high pressure nonsense that no restaurant should indulge in.

I ordered a reasonable amount of food myself - maybe $60 worth of appetizers and a main course, so it wasn\'t like we were being cheap.

There were so many eclectic dishes to choose from.  The signature slaw appetizer could have...been a meal itself.  The cheeseburger spring rolls were messy but delicious.  The flavors in the entrees were plentiful and well balanced.  One entrÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½e we had was the slow braised beef and the other was a beef skewer special menu item.  All dishes are made to be shared among the table.\n\nThe service was okay.  We had made a reservation but were going to miss it due to traffic.  We called about 20 minutes before our scheduled time and let them know we were going to be 20 minutes late.  They said it was fine but it would cut into the max 2 hours we were allowed to be at the table.  We ended up being 30 minutes late and were welcomed and seated promptly.  We had drinks and the slaw appetizer in hand within 30 minutes of being seated.  There were lots of people working and things almost ran a little too efficient.  For example, the beer glass was not big enough to hold a whole can and when I finished topping up my glass and emptying the can, it was immediately taken away from the table.  \n\nIt was strange to me that the second appetizer came out at the same time as the entrees, after we had been clearly done with the slaw for several 5-10 minutes.  But fine, no problem, it was just a lot of new plates on our table at once.  We continued eating for the next 30-45 minutes and then with 10 minutes left in our 2-hour time window, things started to wrap up quickly.  For example, the beef skewers came with these spicy potato straw bites (also delicious).  I had the third-last forkful of potato straws in my mouth when the bowl was whisked away from me without anyone asking if we wanted to finish it or pack it up.  They were never to be seen again.  As soon as our last bites of our entrÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½es were in our mouth, the plates were taken away.  We were given our bill without being asked about dessert 5 minutes before our table time was expired.\n\nI understand we were 30 minutes late so I am not complaining about not having dessert or things moving so quickly.  However, some courtesy words could have been spoken.  Such as, ""because you were 30 minutes late, we aren\'t able to offer dessert today"" or ""we have to start clearing the table, would you like these potato straws in a to-go container"" or ""if you\'d like dessert, you can order it now and wait for it to-go at the front of the restaurant.""  But it wasn\'t even acknowledged at all.  Things just happened.\n\nAnyway, the food was amazing and worth the exorbitant cost.  The experience up to the last 15 minutes was great.

Stelvio,4.5,"791 Dundas St W, Toronto, Ontario M6J 1V2 Canada","['Italian', 'European', 'Vegetarian Friendly']",323,"['Had a wonderful time here - the pasta dish was awesome and the Issa Boca was  great as well - the service was very helpful and friendly', 'Our dinner at Stelvio, Toronto was very good. We tried the deep fried meatball which was tasty and ordered both of their specialties- the meat and cheese platter and the elephant ear pork cutlet as well as some additional entrees. Both of the specialties were...outstanding and should be ordered for the group. The huge pork cutlet was the biggest piece of pork you can imagine. The only disappointment was the passatelli ascuitti which was very, very dry and was served with too much grated parmesan. It could have used a more creamy sauce.More', 'I wish I could give this place a 4.5. The pasta was very good, especially the gnocchi. The squash ravioli was unique and flavorful as well. Our salad was supposed to have pork in it, but there were only two little shavings in the whole...bowl. They were also out of limoncello, which was disappointing, so we didnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t try any drinks. Would I go back? Sure. Are there better restaurants in Toronto. Absolutely.More', 'To begin with, you should know the difference between Northern and Southern Italian cooking before you go here. If you go to Stelvio simply because its an ""Italian"" restaurant, you might be disappointed. You won\'t find a tomato anywhere near this place.\n\nMy expectations were...high, due to social media, but one has to wonder where these 5 star reviews come from. More importantly. always read ""how many"" reviews were written by the review you are reading.  Also, I read several reviews about the pizza but they do not have that anymore and I find that that is a common direction for many fine Italian restaurants. \n\nMy quick summary is that the ambiance and the staff are wonderful. The food, not so much. We had the meatball appetizer or I should say the Mondeghili, which are flattened, deep-fried meatballs but it\'s difficult to taste any meat since the centre of this deep fried patty was more like a pate. It comes with an onion relish of sorts with a balsamic reduction. Overall it did nothing for our palettes.\n\nFor the main we had the Spezzatino Con Polenta and the Risotto alla Milanese con Ossobucco (as opposed to Osso Buco with Risotto), neither of which were up to the expectation built up for this restaurant.\n\nThe risotto was incredibly salty and somewhat crusted (maybe being exposed to air for too long) and not very ""creamy"", and the Osso Bucco, as I mentioned to our waiter was just ""sad"". A smallish portion with the bottom being tough like jerky. Now having had a similar meal a few months ago in Milan, I am not comapring this to that. But even for Toronto, it was just ""sad"".\n\nThe reason I gave this 3 stars is because of the staff. Dorian, a waiter from Belgium did his best to explain how the Osso Bucco was prepared and why the risotto was as salty as it was, and offered to get us something else. But we did not want to cause a ""fuss"". And if the replacement dish would not have been as good, then it would create an even ""sader"" evening.\n\nThe only thing that may have caused this experience is that we went on Valentine\'s Day. Maybe due to the 3-4 seatings on a busy evening, they had required meals to be prepared in advance or maybe the head chef was out for dinner himself. Either way, the food was no where near our expectation, even for a Northern Italian restaurant.\n\nOn the plus side, the wine (while very much over priced - 3x the LCBO) was good. However I was very much surprised they didn\'t have a Lambrusco which is very common in Northern Italy. Desserts were ok.More', 'Was there last June for probably the fifth time (was there both at their current location and their previous location at Queen St W). Great food, great atmosphere, first class service. Can highly recommend the Risotto alla Milanese with the Ossobuco.', ""The food was brilliant.  I went there specifically to have the Orecchia D'Elefante and I was not disappointed.  IÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½d definitely have it again.  But there are other dishes on the menu that I want to try so I guess IÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ll be going back more than...once.  \n\nThe wait staff were incredibly charming.  Attentive without being overbearing.More"", 'Second time dining here for a special occasion and was not disappointed.  This time we got to try more of their unique to northern Italy dishes.  Both time I agreed with the others that the markup on their wine is ridiculously high.  We travel frequently...to Europe, so I just won\'t pay those prices and opted for a cocktail or two instead.

We were expecting a great experience but found it average. \n\nThe appetizers were good but not great.  We had the saffron arancini, cheese and cured meat platters, and the...arugula salad.  The arugula salad was light, fresh and delicious, but the arancini was uneventful, bland and under seasoned. It sat in a tomato sauce that was so sparse it barely provided any flavour to the dish.\n\nAll six of us had pasta entrees - the dishes were under seasoned and uneventful.  The meat/raisin ravioli was strange and the flavours didnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t work together.  The meat sauce was almost non-existent on the classic tagliatelle bolognese, and the tagliatelle with mushrooms, truffle & sausage was cooked nicely, but bland. The gnocchi was good.\n\nThe wine menu is short but we found a nice wine at a reasonable price.\n\nWith the depth in the food scene in Toronto, either the TripAdvisor rating is unwarranted or we were there on an evening when the kitchen staff was on vacation.  This restaurant is not worthy of being in the top 500 (10%) let alone the top 15 restaurants!More', 'A quality experience with a selective menu (instead  of many forms of limp pasta with cream sauce and chicken or multiple pizza as in many ""Italian"" restaurants in Toronto). Starters included crushed potatoes stuffed with onion and chees) and for another dish sauteed spinach.  A...delightful listed salad with fennel was sold out and missed.  Mains included rabbit (delicious), Risotto with Ossobucco and another with sausage.  Various gnocchi were well received.\nVegetarians and glutton free were accommodated, no problem.  Location is fantastic in the Little Portugal part of old Toronto, the surrounding streets containing interesting hodgepodge of old small houses and Dundas Street is a vibrant place to be.

As tourists, we have discovered that it is highly recommended that you make reservations.

Service was excellent from being greeted until the end where the waiter held the door open for our departure.   Service was efficient and served in a timely manner.  Warm bread served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping.  We ordered he lamb shank and seafood stew.  Really appreciated that food was served hot.  Generous portion for both dishes.

We're not locals (central Etobicoke, actually) but HoP has quickly become our go-to dine-in spot (I've written several glowing reviews on various platforms in the short time we've been dining there)....It was the last place we dined before Covid and the first to which we returned when things opened up. What keeps us coming back is the combination of delicious food prepared with skill and innovation, a terrific selection of drinks, and most importantly, the excellent service. Which is why our visit yesterday left us slightly out of sorts.\n\nThe food, as expected, was excellent and although the beer selection was a bit smaller than usual, I was able to find something to my liking. Where things fell down was on the service, specifically with our server. I won't mention him by name as I'm not out to embarrass or humiliate him, but we were extremely disappointed by his almost aloof attitude, his lack of attention to our needs, and his relative disinterest in our dining experience.\n\nSeated between a table of his regulars (with whom he seemed to make the time for idle chatter) and a large family group (which perhaps offered more in the way of gratuity) we were able to witness that he was indeed capable of conviviality when the mood suited. But for some reason, we were grossly overlooked (it's not as if the restaurant was overly busy). Other than taking our drink orders (in a rather rushed manner) and delivering the drinks and taking our food order, we barely interacted with him. I'm sure he's a decent fellow but as far as customer service goes, I think he's lost sight of the customer in the equation. And as I think of it, my first review back in 2019 mentioned that the service was a bit lacking and I'm almost sure it was the same person.\n\nThankfully, he seems to be an anomaly. The saving grace was the exemplary service delivered by his colleagues. The server who brought us our food (we didn't get his name) was friendly and polite, engaging in short but genuine conversation. The standout, however, was Julia, who not only noticed that I was trying to get the attention of our official server, but approached me and asked if I'd like another beer (even noting the specific brand I was drinking). We were quite impressed and wished we could have directed our tip to her alone. She also cleared our plates and checked in a couple of other times. Now THAT is superior service!\n\nFor the casual reader of these reviews, don't be put off. House on Parliament remains a stellar establishment for all the reasons I mentioned in the introduction and is well worth the trip.

The menu is full of delicious classics with a daily specials menu as well. The portions are great especially for the price.\n\nThey now do pickup or local delivery that includes wine,...beer, or cocktail kits. They also sell their famous tomato jalapeno chutney by the jar that goes well with everything!More', 'After a stroll through the Old Cabbagetown section of Toronto, my wife and I found the perfect place to relax, unwind and stuff our faces beyond recognition. \n\nHouse on Parliament is a busy yet welcoming gastropub that serves elevated pub grub raised to a high...level. \n\nFor an appetizer, my wife and I shared the Wild Boar, Pheasant, and Cognac Scotch Egg, served with Branston Pickle, grainy mustard, and Baby Arugula. The seasoning was perfect, the flavours, mouthwatering. I would have maybe preferred the yolks a bit less cooked but thatÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s hard to achieve in a scotch egg. All in all, an amazing starter. \n\nFor my main, I had one of the daily specials: Moroccan Braised Lamb Shank, in red wine, apricot, roasted tomato, sun-dried black olives and mint; just look at that list of ingredients ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ they did not let me down! The dish was served with a side of polenta which I expected to be nothing more than plate-filler but ended up being rich and decadent and full of buttery goodness. More, please. The only downside was the vegetable side ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ not the choice or preparation, but the promise. Grilled asparagus was advertised but I got roasted Brussels sprouts instead. Though they were fantastic, I found it odd that a daily special substituted the veg without even a mention from the server. Luckily I like sprouts ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ but what if I had notÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½\n\nMy wife had one of the other specials: Great Lakes MontyÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s ESB Braised BBQ Beef Ribs with Chipotle Bourbon BBQ sauce, Frites, and Coleslaw. I managed to pinch a taste from her plate and while the portions were ample and the flavours satisfying, I might have like a bit more imagination shown in the braising sauce other than BBQ. But all in all, another winning dish.\n\nA good meal can only be made better by a good beverage accompaniment and House on Parliament has a diverse selection of draft beers along with a couple of ciders (one of which suited my wifeÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s tastes perfectly ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ the Niagara No. 1 Dry Cider). I settled on the GoodLot Bock Bock, a malt-forward lager, with a slight caramel sweetness and a mild hoppy bitterness. Very moreish.\n\nService was friendly but not overly attentive; the restaurant did have a constant flow of patrons to keep the staff hopping so itÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s somewhat understandable. But what sets a restaurant apart for us is not just the food, but the service. An establishment can sink or swim on that, alone.\n\nHaving said that, IÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½d like to give House on Parliament the benefit of the doubt on this one as itÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s definitely a winner. Great atmosphere, great food and drink, and a positive buzz of energy that complements the experience rather than drowns it out.

Wonderful cozy neighbourhood pub, unfortunately not our ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½hoodÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½. So we make a point of finding our way there as often as possible. Always a positive vibe and a buzz...with the happy chatter of friends and families enjoying great pub food. Service is attentive, fun and organized to keep the orders coming. Our usual smoked salmon appetizer was excellent and I have never found another place to top how they serve this with their red onion jam, soooo good! The lamb shank was tender and flavoured with middle eastern spices. The prime rib was perfectly cooked to medium rare (as ordered) with a ample serving of mashed potatoes and large Yorkshire pudding and flavourful au jus. The carrots and asparagus were perfectly cooked and served hot. I have noted some reviews complain that it is the same old menu. I find that they do keep some staple favourites on the menu (thank goodness) but do offer other specials which they change up just enough to keep it interesting. We also noted this time that the chalk boards that usually list their brews, were replaced with artistic renditions depicting Canadian themes artistically created by one of their staff. Nice touch. It will always be on our list to come here. Great team work to deliver delicious food and keeping the patrons happy.More', ""This is a very busy restaurant with a friendly fun staff.

We walked down stairs and into the cutest, quaintest restaurant. Total NY-ky if you know what I mean. The waiter was fantastic and so was the restaurantÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s dimly lit ambiance. The waiter swore by the fried chicken being top 2 heÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s ever had. He wasnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t kidding! And the short rib kebab was the best short rib IÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ve had outside of Bangkok.

The...hamachi is so flavourful with a nice kick to it (after I added in more hot sauce), and the tuna tartare makes a wonderful starter dish.

The roasted carrots make a great side dish! They also make a mean Paloma which is my fav ;) TY for another great night!More', 'Extraordinary meal. As 4 we ordered 4 starters, 2 entrees and two sides.

Not cheap but worth every cent.More', 'Very helpful and friendly wait staff, started with delicious cocktail, and we were a party of four, shared 6 of the small starter plates, and the lamb shoulder with a side of cauliflower, and shared two desserts - it was all delicious, in particular the...beet labneh, the lamb shoulder and the fried eggplant.  Desserts were a perfect way to finish the meal.  Will return for sure!More', 'Really cool place with several distinct areas- a sidewalk patio, downstairs area (kind of small but nice), and a surprising large upstairs area.   \n\nFood is really top quality- the lamb seemed too much for us but we were convinced by our server to try it...as it is their hallmark- definitely glad we did.  They bring 1 lb. of lamb cooked sous vide with great spices.  The server rips it up with forks and then you eat it with lavash bread (and they are able to bring more bread if you run out).   A full tray of nice additional sauces and spices is provided. \n\nThe hummus and wagyu appetizer was also great- really interesting bread (not pita) that came with it- so delicious.   And the pide with wagyu was also very tasty.\n\nService was top notch- she was very helpful in giving tips on what to get.\n\nOverall a great place- it was our very final night of a two week Canadian vacation and this was a great final meal!More', 'We dined here on a Monday night, and considering it was a week night I was pleasantly surprised to see how busy it was. We sat on the 2nd floor, there was a good busy vibe in the place, but in my opinion not enough...servers to accommodate the multi level venue. We did have to wait a fair while to order drinks, and then again to receive these. They were good when we did get them. The hummus was not to my taste, it was very heavy and thick, a bit gluggy. The ceviche dish was very good, we both liked it. The kebab was very delicious, we both really liked this. The salad we ordered was forgotten and brought quite a while after we checked on it. Overall, the slow service and mixed quality of dishes makes this a good restaurant, not great.More', 'Horrible experience \n\nDined here with four friends last Friday. Most of us have been to Byblos before and loved the food. We started out with a bottle of wine, cocktails and appetizers. Everything was great, as was our waiter Cody. We had just started on...the second round of dishes when I noticed a caterpillar crawling out on the table. We alerted a waiter who apologized and got rid of it and sent over the bar manager Tyler. Tyler offered us a complimentary dessert. We had lost our appetites at that point and declined. Tyler offered to remake the dishes but we also said no and just asked that no other courses be sent out. About five minutes later, the two pides were served. Again we asked that they be removed and Tyler brought the bill which had several of the half eaten courses and food we didnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t even touch. Tyler stated he would remove the appetizers. We were pretty taken aback at this point seeing as the appetizers were the only thing we had actually finished at that point. By this time Tyler had been back and forth to our table several times and his demeanour was very rude. Several times we were asking questions and heÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½d speak while walking away from us. We suggested we pay for the apps, wine and cocktails. He said heÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ll call his manager to see what he could do about the bill. We waited approximately 40 mins for him to return and tell us that the bill had not changed and if we still didnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t want to pay, he would call the police. IÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½m not sure why he felt the situation needed to be escalated to that point. We waited patiently, didnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t disturb other diners, and definitely had no intention of not paying for what we ate. It was the most insulting service I have ever had. Instead of creating a scene with police in the restaurant, we took a card and got the managers name, Matt, and paid hundreds of dollars for food we didnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t eat. On the way out, we stopped to talk to another waiter, Jordan, who honestly saved our night. He was gracious and apologetic and took the time to actually speak to us respectfully. The issue isnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t even the bug in the food, it was the attitude of the bar manager, Tyler. ItÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s unfortunate that one person could ruin a great night at a restaurant but the management was appalling and I would never return or recommend it.More', 'DESPICABLE SERVICE. BYBLOS DOWNTOWN DOES NOT VALUE CLEANLINESS OR CUSTOMER SERVICE.\n\nShort story: we found a LIVE caterpillar in our food. Tyler, the closing manager, threatened that if we didn\'t pay for the food that we DID NOT consume he would call the police. As...racialized women, we felt we had no choice but to pay the bill.\n\nLong story: The evening started off great with wine and apps.   We had just started the second course when we noticed a caterpillar had crawled out of one of the dishes. We didn\'t know which dish so we immediately all stopped eating. We quickly caught the attention of a passing server and they removed the caterpillar and escalated the situation to the manager. Tyler was the only manager available to ""assist"" us.  Right off the bat he was unapologetic and tried to offer us a complimentary dessert. We communicated to him that we had lost our appetite and did not wish to continue dining; despite this, a third course was brought to the table. We communicated to Tyler AGAIN that we did not want to continue with our dinner. He removed the dishes and brought the bill. We assumed that Byblos, a well-established restaurant, would not charge us for the dishes we did not consume/had a bug in it.  Any other restaurant in Toronto would have removed those items from the bill, at the very least, or would have comped us for the entire meal. However, when the bill arrived, it included half of the second course, which we never consumed, and he stated that he had \'waived\' the third course (which came after we communicated that we didn\'t want to dine there) as an ""apology"" for our experience (it\'s not an apology when you remove items from the bill that shouldn\'t have been on the bill in the first  place). He stated that mistakes happen and this was the best he could do. He refused to remove those items and we escalated the matter further. He spoke to the manager (Matt) who was offsite. We waited patiently for 45 minutes (we could have easily walked out but we didn\'t). When Tyler returned he provided us with the exact same bill and said that we either had to pay the bill or that he would call the 52 division for non-payment. We were all shocked that he threatened to call the police, especially because we were more than happy to pay for what we consumed. What started as an unfortunate mistake turned into a despicable customer experience. A simple apology and waiving of unconsumed food, which was completely at the fault of Byblos, would have de-escalated the situation. Instead, we were subject to unnecessary threats, including being followed and forced out of the restaurant. We will be making a formal complaint to Dinesafe Toronto and will never be dining at Byblos again.More', 'Byblos was amazing. Our server was excellent. The food was some of the best I have ever had and I have eaten all over the world and the mix of flavours was unbelievable. The restaurant menu is meant to be shared and that we did....We had the Lamb Flatbread, roasted Cauliflower, eggplant Potstickers and a salad. Everything was presented so beautifully and the ingredients were so fresh. The cocktails were hand crafted and delicious well. He did try the cucumber and Celery cocktail it was a fancy mojitos and so good. Will definitely have to return.More', 'After our show we went to the restaurant and luckily were able to snag a table. Servers Tyler and Alexandra were extremely friendly and had great knowledge of the drinks and food. Quiet atmosphere and delicious food. Good value for the price.', 'Great place, friendly service and best of allÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½the food! \n\nMy husband is a wretched vegetarian (!) so sadly I couldnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t try the lamb shoulder I craved, but the waiter suggested I try the lamb ribs instead, and they were absolutely delicious. \n\nI made him get...the dumplings (I actually read reviews) and they were spot onÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½both the other reviewers and the dumplings. Those dumplings were quite unlike any dumplings weÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½d ever had before, and amazing. The beet salad was a little more ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½eh,ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ but the lentil pide more than made up for that.\n\nOh, and the chocolate olive oil cake!! Get that. You must get that! \n\nOverall, the combination of flavors and textures was just out of this world.\n\nSince the Wretched Vegetarian also doesnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t drink, the only drink that was taken, alas, was a citrus gin cocktail, which was perfect for my taste.\n\nWill definitely be back here the minute weÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½re in Toronto again, and weÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ve already recommended it to many people.More']", Toronto

We have been here twice, both times to celebrate a special birthday. We always choose the tasting menu(5 course) which is a blind tasting menu.

ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ What the hack...made those reviewers post such ridiculous BS?! Guess they must be eating under the influence of local anesthetics that had not worn off, after seeing their dentist?! ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½\n\nBack to the meal!\n\nPrior to AloÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s arrival at the Toronto food scene, for the past two decades, George and (ex) -Splendido had been my two most favorite ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½French-themedÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ restaurants in town. Both feature tasting menus with wine pairing and both with gifted students of legendary master-chef Anton Mossiman at the helmÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½..Lorenzo Loseto and David Lee.\n\nAfter an acclaimed two decades, Chef Loseto - winner of the 2014 ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ Gold medal plate Canadian Culinary competition ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½, is still heading the kitchen at George. Not only did this gastronomic stalwart manage to beat out and survive the pandemic scare and shutdown, it is currently in full swing and going strong. Its creative and talented chef and kitchen continue to deliver eye-appealing and delectable culinary fare to the tables.\n\nThis evening, with the help of GPS and braving smog and haze, not to mention the notorious rush hour, downtown traffic and Queen street construction, we miraculously arrived safely at our venue destination. I, with raised adrenaline levels and my eating-partner driver with sweaty palms!\n\nIn the past, for our multi-course tasting menu, my dining partner and I have always been served a separate and different dish during the course of our dinnerÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½..a 7+ course meal for two resulting in an array of 14+ different dishes/preparations. That was fun and showcased the skill and creativity of Chef Loseto and his team. However, the approach also created conflict, dilemma and disappointment for us, in that, in a few instances, one of us was served dishes with ingredients that the other person fancied and vice-versa.\nTherefore, for tonightÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s dinner. to play safe and to avoid disappointment and jealousy, we have requested ahead of time that IDENTICAL dishes of the same course be served to both my partner and myself. This approach also allows us to compare notes of the same dish.\n\nTonightÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s menu approach: We decided to place our gastronomic journey and fate at the hand of Chef Loseto. His multi-faceted, fusion Omakase menu ended up with a superb and imaginative 9 course feast. The dishes include:\n\nAmuse bouche: Stuffed Zucchini Flower Tempura\nAppetizers: Tuna Tataki Wrap\nWhite Asparagus with crudo marinated Hamachi\nSeafood courses: De-constructed Dungeness Crab Cake\nChar-grilled Octopus\nMeat course: Wagyu Beef wrapped grilled Romaine Lettuce\nSeared Foie Gras with Roasted Squab\nMain course: Seared and roasted Venison Rack\nCheese course: Ashley Goat Cheese and Mountain oak cowÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s milk Cheese\nDessert course: Alberobello chocolate and salted caramel Gelato\nCherry, Mascarpone, Mango Mousse Cake\n\nWow! What a surprise and what a meal! The first impression of many dishes were eye-appealingly pretty and busy in a psychedelic wayÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½..an edible Joan Miro Painting?! However to our amazement and surprise, the combined ingredients and products somehow yielded a harmonious mouth feel and taste profile!....a reflection of the chefÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s skill and understanding of the various components and elements used!\n\nOf all the dishes presented, the perfectly cooked, ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½oh-so-deliciousÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ Venison dish rose head and shoulder above the rest and really made my evening! Coming in a close second was the Foie Gras and Squab dish. Again, the main components of this dish were perfectly executed. So many honorable dishes worth mentioning, they included the White Asparagus and Hamachi, the smoky Chargrilled Octopus, the deconstructed Crab Cake, the Mascarpone Mango mousse cakeÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½..etc. IMHO, a more lenient Michelin inspector would have given George a star?!\n\nLastly, a special thank you to our friendly, warm, attentive and professional server - ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½RyanÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½, who kept us entertained in between dishes, due to a packed house tonight!More', 'Came here for our anniversary dinner and we were blown away.

I ordered the tune and shrimp special and tuna was overcooked, and the rest of the dish  was a hot mess. We ordered clams and they were not good either. Ceviche with scallops was really pleasant, the right acidity and the scallops were super fresh. I would also remark their wine selection, having interesting bottles especially in the white section.

The appetizers and main dishes were passable, but considering it's a steakhouse, one would anticipate outstanding steak options.

We ordered the grilled calamari, rack of lamb, spaghetti lobster and linguine preferiti novita. Also a veal dish. We all enjoyed our meal. The lobster in the shell was put on top of the spaghetti.

The bread with EVOO was very tasty.  We had a Cosmo to start and it was delightfully elegant and good.  We had a glass of wine with our meal, followed by cappuccino, which was among the best IÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ve had.

The buns are not toasted, pity, just covering the patties on the grill during cooking. Hence they come out dry and tasteless. The fries are nicely  light brown in colour and of ample portion.More']", Richmond Hill

I remembered this quaint little Hungarian restaurant that we went to years ago and suggested we go there. We...made our reservations for 5 of us for a Saturday night and had no problem getting it. Once inside we were seated to our table quickly and giving our menus.  Though they have other dishes, schnitzel is the go to here for good reason. After ordering our bottle of Hungarian red wine we ordered 2 orders of their famous hungarian goulash soup as a appetizer, which was enough for all five of us to try. Brought over in a cast iron pot, it was nicely seasoned with hungarian paprika and full of dumplings and vegetables and seasoned tender beef. This was a winner and a great start. Next came our house platters for 2. Huge platters of different schnitzels along with rice, fried potatoes, red cabbage, fried mushrooms, cabbage rolls and sausage. Everything was delicious - the schnitzel was melt in your mouth tender and the portions were huge. We had enough food left over for full dinners the next day - well worth the $75. My son had a cranberry brie stuffed chicken breast that was also wonderful - he too had plenty to take home afterwards. While thoroughly enjoying our dinner there was a violinist and piano duo serenading us the whole time. The whole atmosphere was like being back in the old country when times were simpler.

The plates were large dinner plates of about 12"" across. The Schnitzels covered the entire plate and more! Unbelievable! I asked the waiter where the other four people were sitting who would help me to eat this monster of meat.\nWell, one bite into it and I knew that I would not share this thing of divine taste with anyone. Without exception (and I have eaten a lot of Schnitzels in my life) this was the most fantastic and delicious schnitzel I have ever eaten! Underneath this monster was a plate full of fried potatoes and (yum!) red cabbage. It was fantastic! \nThis place got very busy, very quickly, so much so that we had a wee spot of difficulty getting to pay our bill as the two servers were literally run off their feet.

Food came in a timely fashion and all dishes were good. If I could make one recommendation it would be for the chef to use more seasoning in their dishes. Perhaps Hungarian food is meant to be bland, but I think some seasoning would elevate their food.\n\nI was hoping for roast potatoes with some kind of Hungarian flare, but unfortunately they were essentially home fires that were deep fried with no seasoning.\n\nWe also tried the home made Apple Strudel. While it was good, like other dishes it needed something more. WasnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t very sweet and needed more cinnamon perhaps.\n\nOverall a good meal and experience but there is room to elevate the food to the next level.

Terra has always been a beautiful place and although the ChefÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s Table...is a cozy, private room it wouldÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ve nice if it was a little less ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½cozy.ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½  By that I mean the distance of the chairs to the walls is pretty small so you are constantly having to move your chair inwards to allow staff to get past you to serve waterÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½wineÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½food etc.  Not a deal breaker but a little annoying to always be shuffling your chair positions. Service was very good and most of the food got rave reviews.

There were a couple of missesÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ironically on the easiest entrÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½e to prepare and the most expensive item on the menu.  My friend ordered the Seafood Spaghettini but asked to sub Rigatoni pasta instead.  Unfortunately the pasta was under cooked and crunchy. Not el dente'...el crunche'. Poorly cooked pasta should not happen at a restaurant of TerraÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s quality.  On the other end of the spectrum I ordered 4 oz. of the Wagyu beef medium rare and most of it was inedible.  There was so much gristleÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½not fatÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½hard, rubbery gristleÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½on the slices that IÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½m shocked whoever prepared and sliced the beef would serve it because the gristle was very tough to cut and impossible to chew.  I informed our waitress and she was very apologetic and informed the manager who came and apologized as well.  Everything was handled properly and the Wagyu was removed from the bill but again, a high end protein at a high end restaurant shouldnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t be treated like that.  For my appetizers I ordered the Caviar and the Oysters Rockefeller.  I was told the Rockefeller was not available so I subbed in 6 raw oysters.  As I finished the caviar our server returned and said that Oysters Rockefeller WAS available so she brought me my original order.  I found the oysters very dryÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½the topping was firm and crispyÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½not the usual moist flavour bomb of butter and spinach.  It was OKÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½I know chefs like to add their own twist to traditional recipesÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½but I prefer the taste of the original. The cocktails were very good and so were the desserts.

The chefÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s room was dark but perfect for 8 (up to 12). The best thing about Terra is the service. Iris took care of every detail. The food was goodÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½better than SarpaÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s (surpassed their customer care...too). We enjoyed her recommendations: 2 appetizers (buffalo cheese went well with the bread & calamari); 1 Caesar salad; 2 famous seafood spaghetti; 1 tender roast chicken; 2 small steaks; 2 x$45 char fish; and a gnocchi. With three cocktails and a plating fee ($5 each for sliced birthday cake) the total including 20% gratuity was $735.

We were expecting to sit on the back patio but instead were placed in the front by the parking lot.  Our first time there, we didn\'t realize the beauty of the back patio until we had gone to the washroom.  Why weren\'t we given the choice when we arrived?  The first thing you notice when you are seated is that service is very slow.  The waiter came to the table to ask if we wanted bread (we didn\'t) and then disappeared for a while.  It took a good 15 minutes to take the drink orders and at the same time we ordered dinner.\nDrinks:  Cocktails are in the $15 to $17 range and are advertised (in the menu) as having 1.5 oz. of liquor.  I had a pomegranate margarita but could not taste the liquor.  My husband had a raspberry martini and couldn\'t taste the liquor.  Overpriced for fruit juice?  We then waited for our first course - a green salad which we shared.  It came already on two plates, was an ample size and very tasty with a light dressing and a good variety of greens.  We then waited for our mains.  I had the Branzino fillet which came perfectly done on a bed of greens (mainly asparagus which were perfectly cooked while my husband had Crackling Over-roasted Chicken, with lovely crisp skin and tender and juicy flesh also on a bed of greens perfectly cooked.  I thought my fish was a tad too peppery but that is a personal taste.  We started at about 7:15 p.m. (on a Sunday night) and by the time we had finished our mains, it was 9:30!  I wanted a up of decaf and we asked that our bill be brought at the same time.  We waited about 10 more minutes for the coffee and the bill.  Knowing it was my birthday, they brought a dish of a few biscotti and some cookies on a beautifully decorated plate.  Then we waited a bit longer for the waiter to bring the machine so we could pay.  All in all, the meal was beautifully served, tasty and the wait staff were friendly.  But  the service was very slow.  I also thought that the prices were a bit over the top.

The chicken was decent.  The interesting Thai like salad was good. My biggest complaint was my friend that ordered the beet salad with added shrimp.  The beet salad was $18 dollars. Understandable but steep for possibly two (2) beets.  Most offensive was the $30 surcharge for the shrimp.

We made a reservation and it was packed and I had to work my way up to the hostess....but they adjusted down our reservation size while they downsized one huge table to two smaller ones . We waited 15 minutes.  The Peking duck was delicious and there were a couple surprising things like fruit , marshmallows, raisins with the pancakes. I believe it was to give us something sweet for the New year. We ordered the two courses with the lettuce wrap.\n\nThere were set course New Years banquet meals and a special a la carte menu.  We ordered a few more dishes and all were well flavoured and fresh. The appetizer fish of scallop with black bean, pea shoots and egg tofu that surprisingly was topped with a minced garlic and butter based sauce. Was my husbands favourite. The sizes of the dishes were generous and well presented. We packed up some leftovers. \n\nBefore the bill came they gave us complimentary dessert of red rice sweet soup and a new year sweet glutinous rice ball with sweet black sea same in it. Plus gelatine with Gojiberries and crispy sesame cookies .All auspicious items for New Year .\n\nThere was a huge wall of fresh seafood with very clean tanks. All the dishes were in beautiful platters and displays. The dishes were clean and unscathed. I look for those things. I hate it when there are chips where germs can lurk.\n\nCanÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t wait to go during a regular day so I can order things from the regular menu .\n\nSome of the staff canÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t speak English but they will tell you and send someone who could.More', 'I love dim sum and this place is one of the best  It is much pricier then most spots but the portions are much bigger then most dim sum places  It is also pretty crowded so get there early  My favourite of all dim sum...places i eat atMore', 'I reserved 2 tables for their Peking Duck set dinner and we were all very happy with the meal.

A whole geoduck on ice with hot broth to dip into was delicious. So was the lobster in supreme broth with noodles. The bbq pork was also moist and delicately marinated. Peking duck...was the only slight disappointment as the pancakes were way too thick. If you donÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t mind the distance from downtown Toronto then it is a good place to have some specialty food.More', ""Don't go to this place. We got our number for table for two and noticed there were around six numbers ahead of us in line. During our 45 mins waiting time no numbers were called, however we saw the host keep asking some customers to...go inside and gave them tables directly. Apparently this is not a fair waiting game here. Don't go unless you know the host and have a secret fast pass at hand. We leave after waiting 45 mins there and I don't see I will go back again.More"", ""A friend and I had a delicious lunch.  The portions are generous and the prices reasonable.

The second time was on Monday and we made a reservation for two for 11:45 am....We waited half hour to be seated. We were one of the few that were not Asian. They gave us the sheet to fill out our dim sum order and then we waited another 45 minutes before they took that. In the meantime we had finished two pots of tea. Finally one order came and then waited about 15 minutes before the next orders came. After about 1/2 we asked if our last order will show up. Again waited 45 minutes. By this time we were full and angry. I complained so they took 10% off bill if we paid in cash. But we had to complain because they didnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t take the 10% off the bill the first time. In total we waited for our food for about 2 1/2 hours. Will never go back ever. And because we had to pay cash just means they saved on the visa transaction. No tip for them.More', 'Consistently good dim sum. Come before 11:30 am or there may be a long wait. Barbecue meats are usually good. Quite a variety of different dim sum. Parking is very limited in front of the restaurant. More parking on the east side in front of...the Keg steakhouse.More', 'Gotta say they have one of the best dimsum in the GTA. Usually you will see a line up before the restaurant open at 9am each day. If you are unable to grab a table before 9:30, you might as well wait until the next...seating, because people go to dimsum usually spend more than 1 hr just eating and chatting. They have special pricing before 11am, if you order anything after that, the price will return to normal. Dinner there was not too bad, but very expensive. I am not so sure if the quality and taste of the dishes justifies how much they charge.More', 'Still got lots of people, long line!  But the food is not as good as the old days!  Lots of their customers go to Sky View! Might be that the Dim Sum cooks are different!', ""They have a lot of things on the menu that we don't see in Boston for dim sum.  All tasted very good. Only real draw back is the parking and wait.  They have very limited parking right out front, have to park across to the...empty lot.  Also, you need to get there about 15 min before they open if you don't want to wait.  We arrived around 10 am on a Saturday and had to wait over 40 min to be seated.More"", 'We had tried several dim sum restaurants with family and friends in Toronto. This time we wanted to try a different place. A cantonese friend recommended this place, and we found it the best dim sum place we had so far. We were four people,...ordered about 7-8 different dishes and spent about 68 dollars. There was no weak dish. Everything was tasty and not oily. The Har Gow and Sui Mai were especially amazing! We found the price was great too! The managers, Helen and Wilson, were both very nice. They want to make sure we had a good time. We will definitely come back!More']", Richmond Hill

We were three people, each ordered a...main course and drinks; at one point we wanted to order another round of drinks, signaled the waiter multiple times, however, we he continued to ignore us (not sure if intentionally or unintentionally), so by the time he finally came to the table we decided not to order drinks anymore, and instead we just asked for the check.\nThe food was actually pretty tasty, but was shadowed by the lack of customer service (the only reason I gave this review 3 stars).

The manager upon arrival could tell that I had not been served a filet. All apologies and it was replaced with a tender melt in your mouth piece of meat.  Could this have been the issue here as I ordered a fillet without bacon??\n\nAs I said I was not going to mention anything about my meal but the waitress asked. I did not even tell her about the baked potato which seemed days old and reheated. It was terrible.\n\nThe waitress was very concerned and apologetic. She said if I had told her she would have replaced it. I did not say that I saw no one for 15 minutes after the food was delivered. We in fact reassured her that the meat was not her fault.

Never ever go there. Bad bad bad never recommended.', 'My family recently went to this restaurant and figured I should write a review as we were blown away at this place! So, let\'s break it down...\n\n1. Location - it\'s easy to get to. close to the highway exits, and plenty of parking. Having...2 small kids - we didn\'t find it an issue. Mind you - it was Sunday at noon - so that may have factored into it. Unsure of how that area is on weekdays/weeknights/weekend nights.\n\n2. Food - when you\'re asked ""where should i go and have Indian food"" - the Host is generally a top answer. I\'ve frequented the downtown location was ok with their food - however, trying this location out - and I\'m quite wowed by it. They serve your main Indian food - curries, tandoori, naans, rice, etc. However, they go the extra mile with a chaat/bhel station - where the guy is making it FRESH for you! They also have a freshly made gilibi (indian sweet) station - FRESH!! The turnover of food is really great here as lots of people eating and the food was definitely FRESH! Just one thing - I felt the tandoori chicken was a bit too \'saucy\' vs. dry. This is my personal preference though .. the chicken was still really great!! Take note to others - take the tandoori chicken and then put some of the butter chicken sauce on top - it\'s a win win!\n\n3. Drinks - my wife had a lassi and I was able to try it. It\'s really good their mango lassi... I on the other hand ordered a coke - to future visitors - don\'t order carbonated drinks at a buffet if you want to maximize your value! LOL\n\n4. Desserts - usual suspects. However, what blew us away was the fresh gilibi station. A must! \n\n5. Kid Friendly - as I mentioned - two young kids.... and they loved it! They don\'t like spicy food - and we actually didn\'t find the food spicy (ok, maybe a dish or two but generally not too spicy like other places we\'ve frequented). We had our table in the back room - so, there was plenty of space for our group. The servers were really nice with our kids too - much appreciated.\n\n6. Service - no complaints there. They came seeing if we wanted anything, and cleared our plates regularly. Really genuine and nice people and service.\n\n7. Bathrooms - Clean! My little boy had to frequent it a few times - and everything was fine for him. I wasn\'t disgusted like other Indian restaurants I have gone to before.\n\n8. Price - reasonable. We went on a Sunday - i think it was like $21/adult - but worth it considering the many choices, and freshness of the food. \n\nSo - reflecting back and reading my review - definitely positive. I usually like to give some \'criticism\' or suggested areas of improvement - and unfortunately, I don\'t have any - we had a great experience. Thank you The Host!

Our server was very professional and attentive. His knowledge of the menu was spot on and recommended the best wine to go with which mains. We thought that it would be a great idea to share a few appetizers. Crispy calamari is my girlfriend's favourite. It was cooked to perfection ... crispy, hot and tender. Buratta is a fresh buffalo mozzarella served with ripe tomatoes, arugula, smoked salmon in a pesto olive oil .... YUMMY !!! We shared a portobello mushroom salad with goat cheese. These starters were fantastic and couldn't wait for our choice of mains to come. I had a mixed grill (I am a meat lover) of rack of lamb and veal chop. Medium rare is what I asked for and low and behold, it was done perfectly. My girlfriend ordered the seafood Newberg (a selection of shellfish). It had lobster tail, shrimps, scallops in a saffron white wine fish broth cream sauce. The seafood was done just right. Not dry, not overdone BUT fresh, juicy and tender .... PERFECT DISH !  Oh and by the way, the wines recommended with our meals were exemplary. This may sound like a lot of food but we made sure we had room for dessert. We shared a good portion of Carmelina's home-made tiramisu with Spanish Coffee.  This was a VERY SPECIAL night (my girlfriend turned 28 .... I hope she doesn't kill me for revealing her age ... LOL).

The all day breakfast is a must.', 'We all enjoyed our breakfast here. The portions were large and the price reasonable. Cash or debit only. \nNot the prettiest of places outside or inside, but food is worth it.', ""So, let me start with the good points.  First, the three people we dealt with in there were all very friendly, and seemed genuinely liked they wanted to deliver a good experience.  Second, the food was generally solid.\n\nLet's get on to the reasons for...the poor review.  From a practical perspective, the service was exceedingly slow.  We were a party of four, and not in any great hurry, but with only two other small tables occupied, and already eating when we arrived, it eventually became baffling as to why we were waiting so long for any food, especially since our orders were three omelettes and one plate of pancakes.  The coffee took a long time to come, and because our initial server suddenly disappeared, never to be seen again during our visit, there was probably a disconnect.\n\nBut here are a couple of things that you need to know.  First, while we were waiting for food, our soon-to-be server was putting napkins with utencils on the tables, and she dropped one set on the floor.  My wife was surprised to see her bend over, pick them up, and put them on the table.  And it is not as if that floor is sparkling clean.  But here is the real kicker:  my daughter complained that her pancakes, which came to the table looking big, fluffy and delicious, tasted like onion.  I dismissed it as her imagination, but she insisted that she had actually found a piece of onion in it.  So, my wife took the plate, and while she was doing a sampling actually found a piece of onion herself.  When the cook came out of the kitchen, which was in a small sectioned off area right behind us, I called him over and politely explained our observation.  He didn't deny it, and in fact explained to me that the reason was that they only have one pan.  So, because the pancakes were made after my wife's omelette, which did legitimately contain onions, that is what caused it.  I could scarcely believe this.  And, as the family's lone vegetarian, I wondered what would have happened if the bacon were made before my omelette?!  \n\nTo be fair, he offered to make us a new plate of pancakes.  When we declined, he did the right thing and removed it from the bill.  So, as I say, he was nice, and the omelettes were good.  But I feel compelled to warn people that, of the numerous all-day breakfast options available, they may want to skip this one.  Unfortunately, we won't be back again.More"", 'We live in the area and finally went.  Very glad we did.  The food was very good and the portions unbelievable. We ordered a big breakfast, regular size breakfasts and a Nutella crepe.  We had way too much food as the portions were incredibly large....Guess we were use to all the smaller sizes from other breakfast places.

Finally I saw a male server on his way coming towards my table carrying some food in this hand so I waved at him. Although he saw me waving at him, he didn't nod or acknowledge, nothing, so I kept on waving at him. Finally he opened his mouth and said he did see me and he'll come to me when he's free. I think it's common courtesy as a server that if a customer asks for your help and you are not available right away, at least you should acknowledge or you should ask some other co-workers who are available nearby to come to see what I want (as mentioned above there were several of them at the cashier talking to each other). One thing that really upsets me when dining out in a restaurant is to see servers happily chit chatting to each other instead of looking around to see if there are customers who need their service.

The Lamb curry dish was SO small (Probably worth $2-3 to prepare), came with nothing else (Rice would have been nice) and the Biryani was enough for two people. Food did taste nice but I felt it was overpriced for the amount we got.

Never ever go there. Bad bad bad never recommended.', 'My family recently went to this restaurant and figured I should write a review as we were blown away at this place! So, let\'s break it down...\n\n1. Location - it\'s easy to get to. close to the highway exits, and plenty of parking. Having...2 small kids - we didn\'t find it an issue. Mind you - it was Sunday at noon - so that may have factored into it. Unsure of how that area is on weekdays/weeknights/weekend nights.\n\n2. Food - when you\'re asked ""where should i go and have Indian food"" - the Host is generally a top answer. I\'ve frequented the downtown location was ok with their food - however, trying this location out - and I\'m quite wowed by it. They serve your main Indian food - curries, tandoori, naans, rice, etc. However, they go the extra mile with a chaat/bhel station - where the guy is making it FRESH for you! They also have a freshly made gilibi (indian sweet) station - FRESH!! The turnover of food is really great here as lots of people eating and the food was definitely FRESH! Just one thing - I felt the tandoori chicken was a bit too \'saucy\' vs. dry. This is my personal preference though .. the chicken was still really great!! Take note to others - take the tandoori chicken and then put some of the butter chicken sauce on top - it\'s a win win!\n\n3. Drinks - my wife had a lassi and I was able to try it. It\'s really good their mango lassi... I on the other hand ordered a coke - to future visitors - don\'t order carbonated drinks at a buffet if you want to maximize your value! LOL\n\n4. Desserts - usual suspects. However, what blew us away was the fresh gilibi station. A must! \n\n5. Kid Friendly - as I mentioned - two young kids.... and they loved it! They don\'t like spicy food - and we actually didn\'t find the food spicy (ok, maybe a dish or two but generally not too spicy like other places we\'ve frequented). We had our table in the back room - so, there was plenty of space for our group. The servers were really nice with our kids too - much appreciated.\n\n6. Service - no complaints there. They came seeing if we wanted anything, and cleared our plates regularly. Really genuine and nice people and service.\n\n7. Bathrooms - Clean! My little boy had to frequent it a few times - and everything was fine for him. I wasn\'t disgusted like other Indian restaurants I have gone to before.\n\n8. Price - reasonable. We went on a Sunday - i think it was like $21/adult - but worth it considering the many choices, and freshness of the food. \n\nSo - reflecting back and reading my review - definitely positive. I usually like to give some \'criticism\' or suggested areas of improvement - and unfortunately, I don\'t have any - we had a great experience. Thank you The Host! Will be back again someday (unfortunately - it is a bit further from our hose to frequent regularly)!More', 'My family went for buffet lunch. There were lots of options.

I went there, not expecting to encounter the first racist experience I've had since I became an immigrant in Canada....My boyfriend and I arrived at the restaurant around 6:00 pm, and there was another white couple who went in the same time as we did.  The restaurant was indeed full at first glance, with almost no empty seats inside (but also a few empty seats, perhaps for reservation, which is understandable) The waitress was greeting customers inside the bar at the entrance. She was firstly very nice to the other couple, with a big smile on her face and gently told them that they are full right now and asked them if they would like to wait for 10-20 minutes. They accepted her proposal and wait aside.\n \nThen I and my boyfriend stepped up and asked the waitress if we could also wait for a table, since our friend highly recommended their place, we donÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t mind waiting.\n \nHowever,  I didn't expect that suddenly she lost her nice attitude and glanced up and down at my boyfriend and I. Then she yelled at us: 'I just said, no table for today'. Thinking that she might not understand my words---- I wasn't trying to force my way in but I was willing to wait for a table (and there was no one at the patio as well), I explained again and asked how long it would take to wait for a table, Then, I heard her words saying 'not today, it's not going to happen, you must have reservation. She refused to accommodate us, not even trying. We were so embarrassed that we were asked to leave. And we left with shame as if we have done something wrong. We even forgot to get angry and never confronted her. But as we think through the situation over and over. We get more confused about why the waitress refused her service.\n \nI even thought of if there's anything, our words, behaviors or even our dress would offend her. I thought I had asked her politely from the beginning to the end, plus, it is not a 'fancy' restaurant, everyone dressed casually so there's no way that we get refused by dress code. After excluding all possible factor, must admit that there wasnÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t nothing but just our race that had made her treat us differently \n \nThe more I thought about it when I got home, the angrier I got, so I left a message on google maps. I saw that the store manager had responded to almost all the reviews with nice attitude to solve their problems, and he responded fast. so, I thought I'd see if I can get any of their explanation from them by writing down my true review.

I ordered the steak frites ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ the steak was done correctly but by the time it got to me it was not hot nor were the frites.  The other two meals were good (would suggest that with a creamy pasta dish adding a piece of bread to sop up the sauce would have been appreciated).  When the meal was finished, we ordered coffees and a desert.  When they finally came the 2 CappuccinoÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s were not very hot but the 1 coffee was (milk was a little slow coming and a refill would have been nice).  In the end it seems the desert was sent to the wrong table so had to be reordered.  The server (Maria), was excellent so would suggest the focus should be on the kitchen to make things go a lot smoother.  Cold food or beverages does not encourage people to come back.  However, we like the place and will probably return even though it is becoming quite pricy for what you get.\nps. There is a weed garden between the seats on the western patio ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ what is that all about?? ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ picture attached.More', ""Previously gave a very favourable review, but after my latest visit, I won't be returning. The service has deteriorated, they've raised the prices significantly, and the food isn't as good as it used to be. At these prices everything has to be excellent but this...is no longer the case. Sad to see a once reliable spot miss the mark so badly.More"", ""We went to Joey's for a Mother's Day celebration with my daughter, her fiancÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½e. my son and his girlfriend who were visiting from out of town.  We were seated quickly, waited about 10 minutes for our server to introduce herself and take our drink orders,...waited a reasonable amount of time for her to take our food orders and then waited over two hours for our food to be delivered to our table despite my husband speaking to our server to ask what the delay was.  I finally had to go to the front desk and found the man who seated us, told him what was going on, that we had been waiting for two hours, my daughter is pregnant and this was my Mother's Day celebration dinner with my kids.  All this while watching some guy doing some sort of function, not sure what, walking around wearing bicycle shorts and a sleeveless workout tank top.  Some person came to ask about a second drink order and didn't ask my son's girlfriend nor my husband.  Finally someone came to our table to say our food would be out in five minutes.  Two hours too late.More"", ""I have a bias against chain restaurants so I came into this experience without any high expectations. Well, Joey's Markville surprised me. Everything about our dining experience today was way beyond what I expected. Nice environment, attention to safety and distancing, warm and friendly service...and great food!\n\nWe decided to forego appetizers and just ordered entrees. We had the Bombay Butter Chicken and the Blackened Chicken. Both were very well prepared and presented. The Butter Chicken was nicely seasoned with just the right amount of heat for most palates and the rice and pita and naan were great compliments to the flavourful sauce. The Blackened Chicken was such a well composed dish ... perfectly blackened, tender and juicy chicken served over a warm potato salad with crispy bits of bacon, creamy aioli and tons of flavour. The creamy coleslaw was unique and gave the dish a nice contrast.  We had a glass of wine (Pinot) and a draft beer (Session IPA) and both were very good. Dessert was a shared creme brulee cheesecake accompanied by a glass of Cava each (served from a two-serving bottle ... nice touch) and it was so good!\n\nOur server (Jaanuni I think?) was just a wonderful and charming person who, although quite busy, checked in with us regularly, made good recommendations and generally made our experience that much better.\n\nOn the whole, one of the nicest outings we've had recently and I would definitely return to the Markville location (Don Mills is good too, but this was even better).\n\nOne quibble ... we reserved on line days before our visit. We got an update reminder a day or so before but then in the morning before our lunch reservation, we received a txt informing us that if we didn't respond within 15 minutes to confirm, our reservation would be cancelled. This is totally inappropriate and heavy handed. I happened to be away from my phone until an hour or so after this text so, I had to call the restaurant to confirm that they had not cancelled our reservation but this was totally unprofessional and should not happen. Apparently it is an automated message not controlled by the restaurant itself, but it was almost enough to make me cancel. Head office must do something to correct this. It made a very bad first impression. Thankfully, the local restaurant did its job and made our dining experience memorable.More"", ""A little disappointed in my last encounter with Joey Markville.  Had family in and we ordered from Joey.  A very simple order ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ 2 burgers and 2 sandwiches (the cost was over $100!).  When I went to pick it up one sandwich was missing.  The...order was taken down incorrectly so I had to wait 10 or 15 minutes for a remake.  In the meantime all the rest of the food was getting cold.  They apologized for the mistake but that was it.  When we got home the sandwiches and chips were cold and almost missing the crispy onions ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ almost as there were 3 or 4 little bits on each sandwich.  All that being said the burgers were very good after reheating.  The sandwiches not so much.

Value for money proposition is poor, e.g. I object to having to upgrade an already...$33 lunchtime steak frites (before taxes and gratuity) simply to get a tender piece of beef, and a $3.75 surcharge to get sweet potato fries is a bit much - what do yams really cost anyway?

This is a classic dim sum joint that pays homage to the Shanghai Style of cooking.

I do recommend a reservation as I've had people tell me they have waited a long time in line. \n\n     This was a group visit so we ordered a plethora of dishes some common and some new. The servers brought the food out slowly, which was great as we had little room on the table to put many of the dishes. It also gave us a pause between dishes so we could actually enjoy it hot and right from the kitchen. I have been to so many Dim Sum places that just simply pile the dishes on the table and then take off and leave you in an uncomfortable situation and afraid you'll spill something. All the dishes that came out were of high quality and a good standard of presentation and flavour. I really enjoyed the soup-filled dumplings, the stir-fried lamb and the shrimp fried rice. I typically enjoy most of the dishes at this restaurant. I highly recommend this place and I will be back.More"", 'Do not hesitate! This place is excellent.

I saw some reviews below that it was fake here and would like to comment that the dishes were very genuine to the real Shanghai taste, to be fair to the wonderful chefs here.\n\nThe restaurant, although not particularly spacious, especially for couples, would be comfortable enough for a small group of 4-8. The couple tables are quite tightly close to each other but still by the window so if you come here for the real Shanghai taste and atmosphere (but not quiet romance), it should fulfil both your stomach and your mind well. \n\nFor the two of us we ordered one basket of the soupy Xiao Long Bao, the fried dumplings, some buns and a dish of vegetables and it was around $50 tax incl. so it was ok consider the food was really yummy.\n\nNext time I would come with a group so we could order many other dishes too, which we saw other customers happily enjoying!\n\nTips to eat soupy Xiao Long Bao without ruining it: use your chopsticks to lightly hold the top of the bun (the knot) to secure it. Then gently remove it from the steamer.\nTo tell whether the chef is good or not: if you do it gently, the bottom of the bun will not be stuck to the steamer and break, thus releasing all the soup inside.
